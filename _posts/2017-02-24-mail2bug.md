title: "Using mail2bug with Azure App Service and WebJobs to handle support mail"

[mail2bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/mail2bug) is a simple utility that can run as a
scheduled task to scan an Exchange inbox for support mail, log its existance into a bug
tracking system such as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), and even reply with a standard templated
email with links to work item tracking information and other helpful resources.

While not designed for the cloud, this standard .NET application can be run in the cloud thanks
to Azure App Service, WebJobs, and a simple tweak to a deployment script. It's been running for almost a year
just fine.

I've contributed the changes to mail2bug back as a pull request, but it has not yet been accepted.

Last year I adapted a "legacy" open source .NET app, _mail2bug_, designed to run on premise, to work
in the cloud world. This was a pretty quick and dirty operation but it has provided great value to my team -
we essentially have not had to touch the Azure service running mail2bug since then. Many teams using mail2bug
that I am personally familiar with essentially run the mail2bug service on a random developer's machine, so if
there is a power outage, or a security update, or the person decides to leave the company, you're left with
nothing working. Azure to the rescue!

It looks like others might find this adaption useful, so
that's what this post is about. I submitted a pull request on July 13, 2016, but it has not yet
been reviewed or accepted.

## Background: what is mail2bug?

On my current team, the Open Source Programs Office, we help provide the engineering
tools, services and guidance for teams at Microsoft to be successful with their journey
into the open source world. Many teams have been in this space for years now, but others
are just started, but regardless of all that we are ready to help engineers efficiently
use, contribute to, and release open source software.

In a company of over 100,000 people, clearly there will be support volume related to
managing incidents and general questions. While there are many great services available, from
Microsoft Teams to networks like Yammer or even instant messenger, well, Microsoft is a
company built on e-mail, so we have a lot of that, too.

The mail2bug app was hacked together years ago and is best described by me as a "poor-man's [Zen Desk](https://www.zendesk.com)". For
our needs it's great, it keeps track of when we get things, helps us generate reports and respond to issues if we need, and
also to provide a useful general response when we are contacted.

Things we help support including publishing packages such as npm modules, supporting manual
operations sometimes on GitHub repositories, you name it. We try to share the load across
the team.

Mail2bug helps provide some nice features; for example, specialized mnemonics can be used, so
if we reply to an e-mail and include the phrase `@@@close`, the system will close the underlying
Visual Studio Team Services work item that is tracking the incident.

## Why a WebJob?

Since so many engineers now just have a notebook computer the reality is that we don't have any
"random PCs" sitting under our desks to run tasks like the support task. Clearly Azure is the answer: the
Azure App Service (formerly Web Sites) is able to run standard .NET console application as a WebJob,
essentially a simple cloud-based scheduled task or cron job.

The puzzle is easy to put together:

- Create a custom `deploy.cmd` and `.deployment` script to help build the project and place it in the appropriate _triggered task_ location. You could use a continuous job, which is the default for a .NET console app, but we prefer to have the logs and other options available when having triggers.
- Place configuration files in a private repository or other location
- Store the Outlook email account secret information in Azure KeyVault for safekeeping
- Authorize an Azure AD app identify for the mail2bug service to use the KeyVault at runtime

The value is great:

- Automatic deployment is available from a repo hosting provider such as GitHub
- Configuration and updates to the different e-mail addresses and templates can just be done with the source provider and standard pull request review workflows
- No need to worry about managing a server
- App Service takes care of maint. and keeping everything running
- We're able to reuse an existing "random stuff" Azure App Service Plan and instances to run the job, so there's no additional cost to our team for this great service


Hope this helps you to learn about App Service and WebJobs,
