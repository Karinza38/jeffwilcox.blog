<p>Today Will Faught from the Silverlight Toolkit team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wfaught/archive/2010/11/15/transitions.aspx">blogged about the transitions built into the latest release</a> of the <a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/">Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit</a>. Good stuff (Will was the developer for this feature).</p>  <p>In case you haven’t opened up the sample app that came with the phone kit, and just want to see at a basic level what these different transition animations are, I built this quick Silverlight app to show them to you. Click on the name of the animation type to see what it looks like as the out/forward transition.</p>  <div id="silverlightControlHost" style="border:0"><object data="data:application/x-silverlight-2," type="application/x-silverlight-2" style="border:0" width="685" height="585"><param name="source" value="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PhoneTransitionsReference.zip" /><param name="minRuntimeVersion" value="4.0.50826.0" /> <param name="autoUpgrade" value="true" /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=149156&amp;v=4.0.50826.0" style="text-decoration:none"><img src="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=161376" alt="Get Microsoft Silverlight" style="border-style:none" /></a></object></div>  <p>And yes, in case you’re wondering about the beauty of Silverlight code consistency, this app is built by just starting a new Silverlight project and pulling in some of the open source phone toolkit files. Enjoy the transition animations on your pages!</p>
