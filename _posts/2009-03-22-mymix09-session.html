<p>What happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay there. On Friday, I gave a talk at the MIX ‘09 conference about sharing skills and code between Silverlight and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).</p>

<p>One of the most important messages that I had during the talk is the flexibility that the Microsoft Client Platform enables: you can be a Rich Internet App developer today, and build an enterprise Line of Business app tomorrow, since so many of the concepts, APIs, and ideas are shared between these frameworks.</p>
