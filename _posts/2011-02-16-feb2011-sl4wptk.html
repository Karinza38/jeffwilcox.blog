<p>Today we pushed the button on the <a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/60291">February 2011 release</a> of the <a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/">Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit</a>. We’ve added a few new controls that previously app developers had to pick up separately while working on polishing their apps, including the tilt effect and performance progress bar. VB samples, too!</p>  <p><a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/60291"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Feb 2011 Toolkit Release" border="0" alt="Februrary 2011 Toolkit Release" src="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/FeburaryToolkitRelease.png" width="685" height="78" /></a></p>  <p>Please download the new <a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/60291">Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit release here</a>. This is a great download to pair with your updated <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=49B9D0C5-6597-4313-912A-F0CCA9C7D277">January 2011 Windows Phone Developer Tools</a> installation.</p>  <h2>What’s new?</h2>  <h3>Tilt effect</h3>  <p>We have integrated the TiltEffect attached property, allowing developers to really easily turn on the “tilt effect” in this apps, automatically giving buttons, hyperlinks and check boxes the desired tilt effect that is found in many parts of the Windows Phone experience.</p>  <p>MSDN documents are available for this feature:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff941094(VS.92).aspx">Tilt Effect Overview for Windows Phone</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff941108(v=VS.92).aspx">How to: Use the Control Tilt Effect for Windows Phone</a> </li> </ul>  <p>This is the same control that was once presented on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ptorr/archive/2010/08/11/updated-tilt-effect.aspx">Peter Torr’s blog</a> and became <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff941094(VS.92).aspx">a sample</a>, now much easier to use.</p>  <h3>PerformanceProgressBar</h3>  <p>There have been several PerformanceProgressBar iterations, and finally there is one available built-in to the Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit.</p>  <p>This version is very easy to use, you can just drop it on a page, without needing to specify styles like earlier workarounds. Also, it smoothly animates out in an improved way, improving the visual attractiveness of apps.</p>  <p>Simply bind to or set the IsIndeterminate property to get the visual effect. There is no need to visually collapse this implementation.</p>  <p>For some history and other information,</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2010/08/performanceprogressbar/">The original PerformanceProgressBar post</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg442303(v=VS.92).aspx">MSDN documentation about the initial work-around I proposed</a> </li> </ul>  <h3>Bug fixes and feature improvements</h3>  <p>We’ve addressed customer-requested issues and improvements, most in the LongListSelector and transitions space.</p>  <h2>VB.NET Samples</h2>  <p>Now that Visual Basic support is available for Windows Phone, we are pleased to now offer the same sample project we ship with the toolkit, now in VB.NET.</p>  <p>To use VB.NET with Windows Phone apps, you also need this <a href="http://create.msdn.com/en-US/vbrtm">easy download</a>.</p>  <h2>A 1 minute click-through of new features in the sample app</h2>  <p>Here’s a quick video of the emulator running the samples project included with the source download.</p>  <p><object width="680" height="540"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/iTl_MpbDeCQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/iTl_MpbDeCQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="680" height="540"></embed></object></p>  <p>In the video, you see:</p>  <ul>   <li>The tilt effect in use on the main page </li>    <li>The LongListSelector, which has received a number of improvements and bug fixes </li>    <li>The performance progress bar, including a quick demonstration where the blue progress bar (the PerformanceProgressBar in the toolkit) competes against the red standard ProgressBar with the user interface thread blocked. Also, the blue performance progress bar automatically fades out, yielding a smooth UX polish for your apps. </li>    <li>The tilt effect page, where you see a button, checkbox, and hyperlinkbutton being touched, responding with the tilt effect underneath. </li> </ul>  <h2>Earlier phone toolkit features</h2>  <p>As always, there are other useful features for app developers built into the toolkit, including:</p>  <ul>   <li>AutoCompleteBox </li>    <li>ContextMenu </li>    <li>DatePicker &amp; TimePicker </li>    <li>Gestures </li>    <li>ListPicker </li>    <li>LongListSelector </li>    <li>ToggleSwitch </li>    <li>Transitions </li>    <li>WrapPanel </li> </ul>  <h2>Addressing touch responsiveness and list scrolling</h2>  <p>One thing that we’re still trying to find the best solution to is list scrolling. The LongListSelector (LLS) control was designed to help address some of these issues, but we know that we aren’t there yet.</p>  <p>I’ve had conversations with a number of developers both at Microsoft, within the product teams, and with the community out there, to try and compile a list of issues, asks and possible solutions.</p>  <p>We know, for instance, that there are issues with the use of the TouchPanel component that the gesture service is built on, and we want to find a good solution for that.</p>  <p>At this time, LongListScroller is the best recommendation for most apps that need to do grouping, where the standard virtualizing ListBox is not enough.</p>  <h2>A more active CodePlex site</h2>  <p>Another administrative note, we’re trying to keep the CodePlex site at <a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/">http://silverlight.codeplex.com/</a> a little more up-to-date than in the past. You’ll notice that work items should be responded too, and we’re going to keep porting bugs between our Microsoft systems and the external site.</p>  <p>One experiment that we’re doing with the phone toolkit is that we are offering many bug fixes <strong>as they happen</strong> as opposed to at release time; in fact, since the November 2010 Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit release, we’ve checked in multiple updates to the source to address customer feedback, marketplace ingestion issues, and transition bugs.</p>  <p>You can view the latest source code and related check-ins at <a title="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets" href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets">http://silverlight.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets</a>&#160;</p>  <p>Let us know what you think of this more transparent way of working. Hope this helps. (<a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/60291">Download link</a>)</p>
