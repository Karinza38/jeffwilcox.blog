<p>Back in April I <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2011/04/focus-theme/">shared my custom Windows Phone Emulator theme</a>/skin files that made the emulator look like an AT&amp;T phone, the Samsung Focus. I recently realized that the newer <a href="http://create.msdn.com/en-us/education/basics/marketing">Windows Phone Marketing resources on the MSDN site</a> include a much nicer looking chassis mock-up, without branding, and thought I would move to start using something based on it for my development work &amp; presentations that I give.</p>  <p>I’m sharing this with the community, I hope you enjoy! It makes the emulator look great I must say.</p>  <p><a href="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/MyMangoChassisEmulatorTheme.zip"><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/MyMangoEmulator.jpg" /></a></p>  <h3>Download and install the theme</h3>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/MyMangoChassisEmulatorTheme.zip">Download a zip file of these these resources</a> (158 KB)</li>    <li>Ensure the emulator is closed</li>    <li>Locate the emulator directory – usually something like <font size="2" face="Consolas"><strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\1.0\</strong></font></li>    <li>Backup the existing WM7_Skin.xml file if you may want to go back</li>    <li>Extract the files into the emulator directory – note that you will need administrative permissions to overwrite the files</li>    <li>Start up the emulator!</li> </ul>  <p>Enjoy!</p>
