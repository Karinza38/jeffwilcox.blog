Just posting a general update here, hopefully this isn't syndicated on the Silverlight site or anything :-).



I am sorry that all has been quiet on the blog front for a while, as summer rolls around we always find a way to keep busy with a strong set of work items, feature work, and sunshine in Seattle.



<h3>Silverlight testing: what's in the pipline</h3>

I've been working feverishly to get ready a large set of awesome Silverlight test goodness. The first part of that release is starting to happen, so look forward to:

<ul>

<li>Updated Silverlight 2 <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut/">test framework release</a> (<a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2009/07/silverlight-2-unit-test-framework-binaries-updated/">released 7/1/09</a>)</li>

<li>Updated Silverlight 3 test framework release</li>

<li>Command line automation support for the test framework, including build server integration</li>

<li>Code coverage for Silverlight libraries and applications</li>

</ul>



Part of the reason for the delay on the automation and code coverage support is that it's really important to me that the release is of the right quality to be useful. Inside Microsoft, I've released these components and a lot of teams have been helping me to improve the quality and usefulness of tools such as code coverage.



Since I'm not able to dedicate a lot of time to supporting the test framework (it isn't really my job!), having high quality releases helps save everyone time.



<h3>What else I'm working on</h3>

I've also been taking on some new and interesting challenges, some of which I'll be sharing on this blog this summer. 

<ul>

<li>Advanced packaging and source preparation for the Silverlight Toolkit</li>

<li>Authoring the setup experience and toolbox integration for the toolkit</li>

<li>Helping out the IIS Smooth Streaming client team to make some awesome improvements to the Silverlight media experience</li>

</ul>



<h3>I'm part of Silverlight now!</h3>

At Microsoft, every few months we "re-org" enough that teams change names, but really roles and responsibilities rarely morph that much. In case you've ever been handed my business card, you'll notice a distinct lack of job title, team name, or even group name:

With that, I would like to just share that I've joined the larger Silverlight development team, and hope to continue to make Silverlight a world-class leading web platform for application development!



Thanks for reading this far. If you're in the US, have a great July 4th celebration!
