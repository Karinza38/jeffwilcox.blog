<p>In about a month I will be presenting a 200-level session on Silverlight unit testing at <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/">Tech Ed North America in New Orleans</a>. The talk will be an hour with questions, so you can arrive new to Silverlight testing and leave with all the tools you need to be successful in building high-quality applications with the right level of regression coverage that your management can smile about.</p>  <p>The session will be more comprehensive than the overview talk I presented at <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2010/03/mix10-testing-talk-online/">MIX 10 (which is available as a free online video stream now)</a>.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="TechEd_2010" border="0" alt="TechEd_2010" src="http://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/wordpress/2010/05/TechEd_2010.png" width="300" height="123" /> </p>  <p><a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/list?keyword=WEB205">Click here to view the talk information</a> on the Tech Ed site. The tentative information is as follows, but please double-check with the conference schedule builder before showing up:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/list?keyword=WEB205"><strong>Unit Testing in Microsoft Silverlight</strong></a>       <br />Wednesday, June 9, 2010       <br />11:45 AM – 1:00 PM       <br />Room 287       <br />Session Code WEB205       <br /><a title="http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/list?keyword=WEB205" href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/list?keyword=WEB205">http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/list?keyword=WEB205</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Hope to see some friendly faces in the audience! I’ll be up there in some sort of speaker polo shirt uniform with khakis, apparently this conference isn’t quite as trendy and cool as MIX in Vegas ;-).</p>  <p>If you’re going to be attending Tech Ed, I’d appreciate any early comments you have as there is still time to shape the content of the talk.</p>
