<p>If you’ve used the early panorama and pivot controls created by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stephanc/">Stephane Crozatier</a> (controls at <a href="http://phone.codeplex.com/">http://phone.codeplex.com/</a>), you should know that there is now a <a href="http://phone.codeplex.com/documentation">transition guide up on the site</a>.</p>  <p>Stephane did great work by developing this controls early on when we weren’t able to get the official controls out to developers, and I know it really helped a lot of people design their early application prototypes and scenarios.</p>  <p>The programming and declarative markup is pretty similar, so transition should be easy.</p>  <p><a href="http://phone.codeplex.com/documentation"><strong>Click here to view the transition guide Wiki page.</strong></a></p>  <p>Reasons to use the official controls now:</p>  <ul>   <li>Built into the Windows Phone developer tools</li>    <li>Officially supported as part of the platform (user experience matches the platform, will be maintained, etc.)</li>    <li>Full design-time integration</li> </ul>  <p>I want to thank Stephane for providing this guide, plus building the controls, it’s encouraging seeing members of the community helping out with building great experiences, sharing their knowledge, and I’m happy that the transition here has been pretty easy.</p>
