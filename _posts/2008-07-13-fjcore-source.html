<p>Last year I was amazed by the innovation demonstrated by <a href="http://fluxcapacity.net/fluxtools/">Fluxify</a>, a neat online utility powered by the managed code version of Silverlight.&nbsp; The guys at <a href="http://fluxcapacity.net/">fluxcapacity</a> ported libjpeg to pure managed code, so the end result is:</p> <ul> <li>Resize images on the client - yeah, those images that come in through the OpenFileDialog</li> <li>Save bandwidth.&nbsp; Because bandwidth doesn't grow on trees</li> <li>Wouldn't it be nice if Facebook used this, instead of their own custom ActiveX control?</li> <li>You can show off to your friends by uploading your new 200 megapixel camera's images pretty quickly</li></ul> <p>The big news: today they <a href="http://fluxcapacity.net/open-source/">posted the source</a> to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fjcore/">FJCore</a> library on Google Code, so anyone else can get involved in the bits as well!</p> <p>Just to quickly show you how cool and easy this is, here's some C# from the included sample app that does the resizing of a Stream:</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:887EC618-8FBE-49a5-A908-2339AF2EC720:a480ee9e-63e9-42f5-bf5a-a413d8dd2f91" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><pre class="brush: c-sharp">using (fileStream)
            {
                JpegDecoder decoder = new JpegDecoder(fileStream);
                DecodedJpeg jpeg = decoder.Decode();
                ImageResizer resizer = new ImageResizer(jpeg.Image);
                FluxJpeg.Core.Image small =
                    resizer.Resize(320, ResamplingFilters.NearestNeighbor);
                JpegEncoder encoder = new JpegEncoder(small, 90, outStream);
                encoder.Encode();

                BitmapImage image = new BitmapImage();
                outStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
                image.SetSource(outStream);
                OutputImage.Source = image;
            }</pre></div>
<p>That's super easy to use!&nbsp; Check it out.&nbsp; These guys are smart, and it's great that they're sharing their implementation for other folks.</p>
