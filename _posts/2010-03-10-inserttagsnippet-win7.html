<p>The source code plugin that I use on my blog is great, but does require that I insert some escaped tags with special class names in the XHTML.</p>  <p>For years I’ve used the <a href="http://inserttagsnippet.codeplex.com/">InsertTagSnippet</a> plugin by <a href="http://sunali.com/">Coskun Sunali</a> to help me write posts – but on Windows 7, it doesn’t work well without running Live Writer elevated due to the location where it stores and modifies the snippet data file.</p>  <p>I’ve updated the code to use the local app data folder instead.</p>  <p>If you use the plugin and want to give this a try, uninstall the current version and <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/InsertTagSnippetforWindows7.zip">grab it here</a>. It includes the updated Ms-PL source.</p>  <p>Hope this helps. I’ll see about getting these changes into the CodePlex project at some point.</p>
