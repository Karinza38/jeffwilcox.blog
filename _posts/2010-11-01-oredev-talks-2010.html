<p>Next week in Malmö, Sweden, there will be several great sessions on Windows Phone and Silverlight development at the <a href="http://www.oredev.org/2010">Øredev Conference</a>. I look forward to having a chance to present on some great topics and have some fun conversations as well. There’s a good presence of Microsoft presenters at the event, and I wanted to highlight the phone and Silverlight sessions today.</p>  <h2>Getting Started with Silverlight Development</h2>  <p>Monday, 8/11, all day   <br />Tim Heuer, Jeff Wilcox, and others    <br />Firestarter session on Silverlight    <br /><a href="http://www.oredev.org/2010/sessions/getting-started-with-silverlight-development">Link</a></p>  <p><em>In this Firestarted themed session, Tim Heuer and Jeff Wilcox will give you the quick ramp up on creating Silverlight applications for the web, the desktop and the Windows Phone 7 platform.
