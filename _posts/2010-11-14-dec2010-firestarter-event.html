<p>As a developer on the Silverlight team, I get the joy of seeing the many code review and checkin e-mails that our dev team is doing. It’s exciting, and sometimes I do wish I could share that sort of thing with the world.</p>  <p>We’ve been hosting Silverlight FireStarter events for some time, but in light of recent confusion and happenings in the world of the Silverlight, the next one on 12/2/10 is just that much more important: the keynote by Scott Guthrie will be on “Future of Silverlight”.</p>  <p>Here’s the marketing graphic for the event, please tune in!</p>  <p><a href="http://www.silverlight.net/news/events/firestarter/"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: ; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Firestarter" border="0" alt="Firestarter" src="http://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/wordpress/2010/11/Firestarter.png" width="579" height="154" /></a></p>  <p><a title="http://www.silverlight.net/news/events/firestarter/" href="http://www.silverlight.net/news/events/firestarter/">http://www.silverlight.net/news/events/firestarter/</a></p>  <p>There is actually a lot more on the schedule than just that keynote, too.
