<p>You’ve heard me preach it before: fix those margins, align, and try and make your apps as beautiful and inspiring as you can (see also: <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2011/03/metro-design-guide-v1/">my designer tips for developers</a>).</p>  <p>On Thursday, I stopped by the Windows Phone Design Team’s beautiful studio space here on campus. It’s a really creative space, packed with fun people, chill music, and a genuine desire to see even better, more beautiful apps in the marketplace.</p>  <p>While sitting with two of the UX designers, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/corrinab">Corrina</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/arturot">Arturo</a>, and talking about some of these design principles, I just happened to be introduced to a nifty, albeit simple, gridline/grid that the team’s been using for some time while working on the Windows Phone. It’s just a set of red squares, 25x25 pixels, offset 12 pixels from one another, and all contained within a page padding of 24px. (Again: the magical Metro number is 12-based on those edges)</p>  <p>The design typically will use a Photoshop layer containing these squares, or maybe some XAML inserted on top of a page in an app, to work on alignment, visualizing the grid, etc., and making tweaks.</p>  <p>I got to thinking: it would be nice if this could be just like the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg588380(v=vs.92).aspx">performance counters</a> that we have for the Windows Phone: at debug time, you could opt into overlaying this grid on top of the frame of the entire app, being omnipresent. I coded up a quick implementation during that meeting and here it is!</p>  <p>To use the counter, simply open up the <strong>App.xaml.cs</strong> file (where the other performance counters are) and add this in. I’d recommend just enabling it when you want to do a quick design pass. You can use this then both with apps on your phone as well as the emulator; it’s helpful in the emulator since you can then screenshot the UI and share that with your friends and family who can critique you on your pixel placement.</p>  <pre class="brush: c-sharp">// Show graphics profiling information while debugging.
if (System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached)
{
    // Display the current frame rate counters.
    Application.Current.Host.Settings.EnableFrameRateCounter = true;

    // Display the metro grid helper.
    MetroGridHelper.IsVisible = true;</pre>

<p>Here’s what it looks like at runtime in a very simple app:</p>

<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="PhoneMetro" border="0" alt="PhoneMetro" src="http://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/wordpress/2011/10/PhoneMetro.png" width="480" height="800" /></p>

<p>In this example, I have one of the classic Windows Phone design “bugs”: one of the TextBlocks has just been inserted, without using the appropriate standard phone style. As a result, it has a Margin value of “0” instead of being 12 pixels offset from the left. It’s more clear now with the squares, since you can see the misalignment easily.</p>

<p>I’ve also added simple static properties for <strong>Opacity</strong> and <strong>Color</strong> if you’d rather not use the Red default color and ~0.15 opacity on the squares. The IsVisible property can be flipped off at runtime, but beware that the grid is still present in the visual tree once you add it – so there will be a performance hit (don’t ship an app that uses the grid in release builds).</p>

<h3>Get the source</h3>

<p>I’ve published the source file on NuGet – that’s a really easy way to get the file into your project, and if I make any fixes or add features in the future, it’ll be easy for you to get those changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have NuGet installed (<a href="http://www.nuget.org/">http://www.nuget.org/</a>) </li>

  <li>Install the package using the console or package manager. It is called <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/MetroGridHelper"><strong>MetroGridHelper</strong></a>

    <br /><font style="background-color: #ffff00" size="2" face="Consolas"><strong>PM&gt; Install-Package MetroGridHelper</strong></font></li>
</ul>

<p>Or you can drop this source code into a new file of your project, MetroGridHelper.cs:</p>
