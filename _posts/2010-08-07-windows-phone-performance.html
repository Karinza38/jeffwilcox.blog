<p><em>Update 11/15/2010: I've been told that the team working on getting this document online has removed it from the download. For now, instead, you should actually see this reference online at MSDN here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff967560(v=VS.92).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff967560(v=VS.92).aspx</a>, Sorry for any confusion, I'm not sure why they removed the darn thing!</em></p>

<p>Our perf whitepaper has made it out in the wild, please take a look at “<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/confirmation.aspx?familyId=3a8636bf-185f-449a-a0ce-83502b9ec0ec&amp;displayLang=en">Creating high performance Silverlight applications for Windows Phone</a>” – the download includes not only the whitepaper, but also sample applications.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/confirmation.aspx?familyId=3a8636bf-185f-449a-a0ce-83502b9ec0ec&amp;displayLang=en"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" class="wlDisabledImage" title="CreatingHighPerformanceSilverlightForWindowsPhoneApps" border="0" alt="CreatingHighPerformanceSilverlightForWindowsPhoneApps" src="http://az414997.vo.msecnd.net/wordpress/2010/08/CreatingHighPerformanceSilverlightForWindowsPhoneApps.png" width="685" height="65" /></a></p>  <p>Some of the features it covers:</p>  <ul>   <li>Compositor thread and user interface thread</li>    <li>Frame rate counter &amp; cache visualizations</li>    <li>Cache mode</li>    <li>Fill rate concepts</li>    <li>Loading images larger than 2000 x 2000</li>    <li>Navigating into pages in other assemblies</li> </ul>  <p>Some tips it includes:</p>  <ul>   <li>Using Opacity = 0 to hide objects and reduce the fill count</li>    <li>Using images over XAML for some graphics that don’t need to be vectors</li>    <li>Minimizing the code in constructors and initialization code paths</li>    <li>Using Dispatcher.BeginInvoke at startup to get initialization work happening quickly, but after rendering the screen</li>    <li>Using async</li> </ul>  <p>It includes sample apps that demonstrate concepts:</p>  <ul>   <li>Examples about fill rate</li>    <li>How to hide objects using Opacity = 0</li>    <li>Loading large images</li>    <li>Per-frame callback implications</li>    <li>How to split code across DLLs to improve app startup time</li> </ul>  <p>This was created by performance experts on the phone and Silverlight teams, and even I’ve even contributed to the whitepaper – the frame rate counters image from my blog is in there.</p>  <p>I’ll also be covering many of these topics in depth on this blog going forward.</p>  <p>Hope this helps.</p>
