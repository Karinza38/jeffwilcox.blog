<p>I took a few minutes today to build and share this updated set of assemblies that are Mango beta-compatible for phone developers. These can also be used with the RTM of phone, SL3, etc. There were some XAML syntax errors in code that was previously not exercised, oops.</p>  <p><a href="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/TestFx20110609.zip"><strong>[ZIP, 518K]</strong> Silverlight Unit Test Framework Assemblies compatible with Mango Beta Tools</a></p>  <p>Iâ€™ve enclosed the license file, too. Sorry it took so long to get out, Jon.</p>  <p>Hope this helps.</p>
