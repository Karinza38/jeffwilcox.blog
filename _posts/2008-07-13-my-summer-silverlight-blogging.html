<p>It's summertime in Seattle, and the warmth throws everything off just a little (and that's a good thing).&nbsp; I got a little too much sun waiting 7 hours in line at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/universityvillage/">University Village Apple Store</a> on Friday to upgrade to an iPhone 3G (16gb model, black color)...&nbsp; So I'm hiding from the sun today, and catching up on work.</p> <p><img alt="Seattle, Washington. June 2008. Jeff Wilcox." src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/SeattlePano0807.png"/>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tonight I wanted to take some time to share some of the work I've been doing in the Silverlight space, a list of some upcoming blog posts and technologies I'm hoping to cover, and then links to some good, current resources on Silverlight.</p> <p>Earlier today I posted a few quick technical postings:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/07/13/visibility-type-converter/">Value converters and data binding in the Silverlight data grid</a>  </li><li><a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/07/13/fjcore-source/">Fluxcapacity's FJCore source being available</a>, allowing client side JPEG resizing in Silverlight</li></ul> <h3>What's in the pipeline for Silverlight test developers</h3> <p>A lot of recent feedback I've heard from people around the world has helped me to plan the next set of improvements for the unit test framework.&nbsp; Thanks for all the suggestions and questions!</p> <p>I don't have any public timelines for these right now, but do want people to know that I'm working hard to at least get prototype-quality bits prepared that I can write about.</p> <p><strong>Unit testing fx update</strong><br />The test framework's source code is being updated to better conform with design guidelines that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/">Brad</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/">Krzysztof</a> would approve of... this also includes implementing a few oft-requested features:</p> <ul> <li>Support for grouping &amp; tagging tests, so developers can run specific sets of tests easily.  </li><li>Refactoring and renaming parts to make the framework more discoverable and easier to learn.  </li><li>Implementing support for a test service that allows out-of-process communication with the test framework, on both Windows and Mac.</li></ul> <p><strong>Continuous integration support</strong><br />The test service for the framework enables the use of a console test runner script.&nbsp; As long as your integration system runs in an interactive console, you'll be able to plug in your rich Silverlight unit tests using CruiseControl.NET, Team Foundation Build, or a MSBuild task.</p> <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/silverlight/ContinuousIntegrationSupport.png"/> </p> <p>The console runner is implemented in Python, for a nice cross-platform and cross-browser solution that works in Windows and OS X.&nbsp; The script does not host Silverlight in the console, but instead actually opens and controls browser instances.&nbsp; This allows your tests to work with Silverlight UI elements, the browser, and even integrate your own visual verification system if you had some time to spare.</p> <p><strong>Code coverage</strong><br />I've been prototyping a code coverage solution for Silverlight, and hope to have something figured out.&nbsp; Stay tuned for details, this is a tricky problem.</p> <p><strong>Extensible test harness &amp; unit test provider</strong><br />Inside the test framework for Silverlight, there's a pretty simple "unit test provider" model that makes it easy to extend or alter the system to meet your needs.</p> <p>One proof-of-concept project I did was get NUnit's metadata to work within the Silverlight framework, just by creating a provider that maps NUnit metadata to generic unit test interfaces inside the Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.dll assembly.&nbsp; I'll be documenting this unit test provider functionality in a future blog post.</p> <p><strong>Asynchronous testing guides</strong><br />The "asynchronous" test support in the Silverlight test framework is designed to allow a test method to queue up a set of conditional, callback, and other work items that run after the method has returned.</p> <p>Typically any and all test methods that use this functionality are much more than a "unit" test, but I think the capability is powerful, and it's helped our control developers get even more coverage for their work earlier in a product cycle.</p> <p>Here's the quick rundown of what this is about (and in the current test framework assemblies):</p> <blockquote> <p>The enqueue calls don't actually run in another thread like an asynchronous delegate in the full .NET Framework, but instead they manage a set of test work items in the framework.&nbsp; This allows the managed code stack to fully unwind, returning control to the web browser to perform other work on the same UI thread. </p> <p>The framework is then instantiated again-and-again, until all of the work items have been completed on the UI thread (which your tests should not block).</p> <p>This allows for tests that update the UI of the browser or Silverlight plugin, and doing some other neat things.</p></blockquote> <p>I'll be posting some detailed tutorials and walkthroughs on the topic later this summer.&nbsp; In the meantime, check out:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://jonas.follesoe.no/">Jonas Folles√∏</a> has written a <a href="http://jonas.follesoe.no/PermaLink,guid,f2fc834b-704e-40ae-9684-44cfa8096bed.aspx">nice walkthrough of the asynchronous testing capabilities</a>, and provided neat annotations of the code along the way.  </li><li><a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/">Nikhil Kothari</a> used the [Asynchronous] attribute to test a <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Silverlight-ViewModel-Pattern.aspx">ViewModel pattern app that integrates with Amazon product search</a>.</li></ul> <h3>What others are writing about Silverlight</h3> <p>A lot of folks at Microsoft have been keeping busy creating excellent content:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/">Shawn Burke</a> updated his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/07/09/updated-silverlight-control-tutorial-for-silverlight-2-beta-2.aspx">Silverlight control tutorial sample for Beta 2</a>.&nbsp;
