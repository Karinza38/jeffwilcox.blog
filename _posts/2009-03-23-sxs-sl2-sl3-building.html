title: Building Silverlight 2 and Silverlight 3 Beta applications on the same machine
excerpt: Although the Silverlight Tools don't have a multi-targeting story, you can
  build Silverlight 2 and Silverlight 3 Beta applications on the same machine. Here's
  information on how we do this within the Silverlight Toolkit team.

The Silverlight Tools don't have multi-targeting support today, so if you want to continue building Silverlight 2 applications (for production sites), while experimenting and learning about the Silverlight 3 Beta, it isn't that easy.



On the Silverlight Toolkit team, we leave it up to individual team members to decide what core development environment they want. By having the Silverlight 2 and Silverlight 3 SDKs checked into our source enlistment, our TFS build server can produce Silverlight 2 <i>and</i> Silverlight 3 binaries, and we can also msbuild the same bits on our machines, regardless of the Silverlight Tools, SDK, or runtime installed on our machines.



I <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2009/01/independent-silverlight-msbuild/">blogged about this back in late January</a> about "building Silverlight code on machines without the SDK installed," though really it was more about "building Silverlight code for multiple Silverlight versions."



<h3>Select your primary development environment</h3>

Decide whether you would like to do primarily Silverlight 2 or 3 development. Then, install the accompanying tools install, and Expression Blend version.



It is time consuming to move between the two environments, but you can actually uninstall/reinstall the shipping runtime or developer runtime versions of Silverlight if you need to test an app in a specific configuration, without having to do a full reinstall of the <i>tools</i>.



<h3>Preparing your source enlistment</h3>

<p>On the Toolkit, we have a directory of external tools and engineering resources. One of these contains the Silverlight SDK’s assemblies, libraries, and build scripts, as shown in the video.</p>

<ul>

<li>Create a directory to store the MsBuild assets for Silverlight, and copy in the files from %programfiles%MSBuild\Microsoft\Silverlight\v2.0. </li>

<li>Copy the “Reference Assemblies” directory from %programfiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v2.0\ into the tools directory. </li>

<li>Copy the “Libraries” directory from %programfiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v2.0\ into the directory. </li>

</ul>

<p>You can then use relative paths in your projects or custom build targets to get things rolling.</p>



<h3>How we use a custom &lt;Import /&gt; element in projects</h3>

Our source code enlistment is broken up into a Silverlight 2 and a Silverlight 3 branch of nearly-identical trees of code. By using a centralized msbuild .targets file, we're able to leave it up to a single file in the branch to select which verison of Silverlight the application should build with.



This actually even works when building in Visual Studio, so opening a project that uses this method, while using the Silverlight 3 Tools, but building a Silverlight 2 app, will build with the verison 2 SDK. Do note that the design-time experience won't work in this scenario.



<h4>Silverlight.CSharp.targets</h4>

All of our VB and C# source projects for Silverlight, within the source enlistment, reference a relative path, typically something like ..\..\Silverlight.CSharp.targets, instead of the standard Silverlight CSharp targets from the Silverlight MSBuild scripts.



Inside this relative path, it defines the properties. For Silverlight 2:

<pre class="brush: xml">

&lt;Project

  ToolsVersion=&quot;3.5&quot;

  DefaultTargets=&quot;Build&quot;

  xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003&quot;&gt;



  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;

    &lt;!-- Define the ExternalTools property first --&gt;

    &lt;SilverlightBuildResources&gt;$(ExternalTools)\Silverlight\v2.0\&lt;/SilverlightBuildResources&gt;

    &lt;TargetFrameworkDirectory&gt;$(SilverlightBuildResources)Reference Assemblies\&lt;/TargetFrameworkDirectory&gt;

    &lt;TargetFrameworkSDKDirectory&gt;$(SilverlightBuildResources)Libraries\Client\&lt;/TargetFrameworkSDKDirectory&gt;

    &lt;SilverlightRuntimeVersion&gt;2.0.31005.0&lt;/SilverlightRuntimeVersion&gt;

  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

  &lt;Import Project=&quot;$(SilverlightBuildResources)Microsoft.Silverlight.CSharp.targets&quot;/&gt;



&lt;/Project&gt;

</pre>



And for Silverlight 3 Beta:

<pre class="brush: xml">

&lt;Project

  ToolsVersion=&quot;3.5&quot;

  DefaultTargets=&quot;Build&quot;

  xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003&quot;&gt;



  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;

    &lt;!-- Define the ExternalTools property first --&gt;

    &lt;SilverlightBuildResources&gt;$(ExternalTools)\Silverlight\v3.0\&lt;/SilverlightBuildResources&gt;

    

    &lt;TargetFrameworkDirectory&gt;$(SilverlightBuildResources)Reference Assemblies\&lt;/TargetFrameworkDirectory&gt;

    &lt;TargetFrameworkSDKDirectory&gt;$(SilverlightBuildResources)Libraries\Client\&lt;/TargetFrameworkSDKDirectory&gt;

    &lt;SilverlightRuntimeVersion&gt;3.0.40217.0&lt;/SilverlightRuntimeVersion&gt;

  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

  &lt;Import Project=&quot;$(SilverlightBuildResources)Microsoft.Silverlight.CSharp.targets&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/Project&gt;

</pre>



Hope this helps and is useful to you and your development team.
