<p><em>Preface: One thing I've been meaning to do on my blog is introduce a number of the team members that I've been working closely with, to help give some insight into life inside the Microsoft Developer Division.&nbsp; This marks the first of hopefully many such introductions.</em></p> <p>The software industry has shipped excellent products in English, for United States keyboards.&nbsp; But with modern frameworks fully supporting globalization and localization, we really should be spending more time making sure that we properly develop our applications to support a worldwide audience.&nbsp; Dennis is one of many folks working day and night to improve the development process, overall quality, and education of developers to improve the state of things.</p> <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ddietric/default.aspx"><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/DennisDietrich.png"/></a></p> <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ddietric/default.aspx">Dennis Dietrich</a> is a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) who is passionate about doing globalization and localization <em>right</em>.&nbsp; And right the first time.&nbsp; A German expat living in Bellevue, WA, Dennis has created a body of excellent blog content that is worth taking a look at:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ddietric/archive/2008/02/05/yacvcp-yet-another-currentculture-vs-currentuiculture-post.aspx">Yet Another CurrentCulture vs CurrentUICulture post</a> (a must read!)  </li><li>A <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ddietric/archive/2008/03/11/reflector-add-in-proof-of-concept-for-highlighting-platform-apis.aspx">Reflector plugin</a> to highlight Silverlight platform APIs  </li><li>And as a Mac guy, Dennis of course shows everyone <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ddietric/archive/2008/03/05/setting-up-silverlight-2-remote-debugging-on-mac-os-x.aspx">how to setup remote debugging on OS X</a> for Silverlight 2 Beta 1</li></ul> <p>Before working in the division on projects like Silverlight &amp; code-name "<a href="http://windowsclient.net/acropolis/">Acropolis</a>," Dennis was a developer in localization in Dublin, Ireland, where he was a member of the team that shipped Office for Macintosh in Dutch for the first time.</p> <p>I hope you find Dennis' blog interesting, I'd highly recommend subscribing to it.&nbsp; He's been pushing hard on globalization and localization scenarios in our Silverlight 2 work.</p>
