The Silverlight Unit Test Framework ships officially inside of the <a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/">Silverlight Toolkit</a>, since the team has a dependency on it for thousands and thousands of unit tests.

I recently did hear a few complaints that the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut">Silverlight Unit Test Framework site</a> on the MSDN Code Gallery is a little out of date. I hear you, and am going to try to refresh the wiki and documentation a little bit.

In the meantime, I've updated the site with the latest Silverlight 2 Unit Test Framework binaries for download. Here's a <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=silverlightut&DownloadId=6400">direct link to the download</a>. I don't have any updated bits available for the Silverlight 3 Beta at this time.

<h3>What's new in the July 2009 bits of the Silverlight Unit Test Framework?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Support for the [Timeout(...)] attribute on test methods.</li>
<li>Improvements to the Test Service interface. The service now has an asynchronous reporting phase that allows for more robust automation options (details coming soon).</li>
<li>Minor interface changes</li>
<li>Minor bug fixes</li>
</ul>

I'll try and get updated templates produced this month as well. Hope this is useful!
