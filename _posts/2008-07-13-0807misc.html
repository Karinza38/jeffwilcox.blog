<p>Here's some random comments I've prepared recently.&nbsp; A few cool Adobe links, a work office location update, then a quick vacation recap.&nbsp; Probably hardly warrants a dedicated posting, and is thoroughly not Silverlight related (sorry!).</p> <h3>Adobe MAX conference mini site, ActionScript 3 stuff</h3> <p>The <a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/experience/">MAX 2008 North America mini site</a> is a fun rich experience.</p> <p><a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/experience/"><img alt="MAX 2008 mini site" src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/maxsite.png"/></a> </p> <p>I like how the app's startup sequence moves from an initial informative menu of options to a video with Kevin Lynch and then eventually the interactive background environment appears.&nbsp; Pretty slick.</p> <p>The interactive background has a lot of neat elements, and I'm still discovering new functionality.&nbsp; It's an engaging, well-designed site.&nbsp; If I was an artist I'd consider replicating something similar in Silverlight, just to see how the experience would go.</p> <p><strong>ActionScript 3 intro deck<br /></strong>I often get asked to recommend Flex and ActionScript learning materials, and a resource that came to my attention recently deserves a call-out: <a href="http://gskinner.com/talks/as3workshop/">Grant Skinner's slide deck</a> for his one day workshop <a href="http://gskinner.com/talks/as3workshop/">introducing ActionScript 3</a>.&nbsp; Check it.</p> <p>I also ran across a really cool Flash 9 page today: it has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0MSuyaKMk">dancing kittens</a>.</p> <h3>I've moved to Building 40</h3> <p>Check it out - the new office, on the 4th floor of building 40 on main campus.&nbsp; In the scheme of things, it's not that far away from my last building, number 42... Microsoft internal folks, stop by sometime and say 'hi'!</p> <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/myb40office.png"/>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Quick SFO note</h3> <p>A few weeks ago I flew down to San Francisco for the weekend to get some fresh air and explore the city.&nbsp; It was a good time, and I was able to write a few <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> reviews from it.&nbsp; It's a great city.</p> <p>Last week I was introduced to someone who had a "oh, <em>you're Jeff Wilcox</em>" moment - followed by a request to post a photo to my blog for customers and others to see.&nbsp; So, here you go.&nbsp; The slightly balding top is a key give-away that it's me.&nbsp; </p> <p>The next time you see me at a conference or event, please introduce yourself, I'm open to a wide range of (mostly geek) conversation.</p> <p><img alt="Jeff Wilcox, June 2008" src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/0806sfo.png"/> </p> <p>Next time I'm in San Francisco I'll let folks know to setup a geek dinner or drinking event.&nbsp; My sister took the above photo of me in the tea garden in the middle of <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-gate-park-san-francisco">Golden Gate Park</a> (thanks!).</p> <p><strong>SFMOMA's personal photography policy is pretty cool</strong><br />A surprise during my time in San Francisco was enjoying the new personal photography policy at the <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a> (SFMOMA).</p> <p>Unless explicitly marked in an exhibit, personal, non-flash, no-tripod photography is permitted in the museum.</p> <p>This is a step in the right direction I believe, in the digital age it's nice to be able to take a quality photo with a digital cam, it's great to share photos with friends &amp; family over Flickr.com, especially those who weren't able to come with me to the museum.</p> <p>Here's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko">Mark Rothko</a> from the museum. I've had a beautiful print of this very painting at home for years now.</p> <p><img alt="A Mark Rothko piece at SFMOMA.  Image for personal use only." src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/sfmoma.png"/>&nbsp;</p> <p>That's it for the random blog posts for a few months.&nbsp; I hope everyone's having a great summer!</p>
