In this post I'm going to introduce the reports that we have begun generating and
sending to Microsoft GitHub users to help improve organization, repo and team
management at scale by increasing the visibility of potential issues and also
reminding people about their work in-progress.

Hope this is of interest to you. If you are interested in contributing to or
using the open source management tools that Microsoft uses, check out the
open source portal's open source code at [https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-portal](https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-portal). The project is implemented in
Node.js and runs great on Azure.

Over time I'd love to refactor this code to be more componentized to make it easier for people to subscribe
to the functionality they are interested in without commiting to a monolith.
