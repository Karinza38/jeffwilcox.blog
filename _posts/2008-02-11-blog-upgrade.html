I'm in the process of upgrading my blog and transitioning to use WordPress in order to take advantage of some new features, including enhanced spam protection.Â  I'll continue to cross-post between MSDN blogs and my WordPress site, however all discussion will take place on the new site only.

The easiest way to make sure that you're always receiving the best content is by subscribing to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/JeffWilcox/" title="My FeedBurner URL">FeedBurner feed</a> with your blog reader, or just checking out <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/" title="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/">http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/</a>.

Looking forward, I'm going to be better able to share knowledge, samples, and other information by hosting sample Silverlight applications, APIs, and media.
