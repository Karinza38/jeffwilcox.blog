*After commuting home from the office I carefully park, step out of the car, grab the 
charging cable looped around the Tesla Wall Connector, press the button on the cable, 
and the car's charge port door opens, letting me quickly plug in the car.
I wake up in the morning with the confidence that I can go anywhere I need to: work, 
weekend errands, travel over a nearby mountain pass…yet **getting to this basic routine
took over 4 years. EV charging can be an uphill battle in many condo associations**.
Without a clear path to charging at home, I wouldn't have placed an order for a
Tesla and would still be driving a German sports car.*

# Overview

Installing Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) for any electric car is straightforward and 
can often be done in a single-family home garage for under $700, including an electric permit and inspection;
yet an EVSE install in a large multi-family building can easily cost $3,000-10,000 or more per 
port once electric infrastructure costs, wire, long conduit runs, and core drilling costs are factored in.

The downtown Seattle condo tower I live in was constructed in 2002 and has 200 units, 250
parking spaces in 4 underground levels, constructed of steel and post-tensioned concrete. We
have gigabit community WiFi in the garage which is great for getting Tesla software updates.

The building's electricity is 3-phase 480Y/277V AC served by Seattle City Light. Even if a building 
like ours has sufficient remaining capacity to support charging loads without a larger
utiliy transformer, preparing for many Electric Vehicle (EV) charging installations can get
expensive: there may be a need for switchgear work, breakers, step-down transformers,
new panels or sub-panels, running conduit hundreds of feet through multiple levels of concrete).

Washington State is _not_ a "right-to-charge" state, so there is no law requiring an
apartment or condo to allow EV charging. The [Seattle Electric Code](http://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes-we-enforce-(a-z)/electrical-code) (2014, 2017)
is requiring new buildings to provision capacity (feeders, panel space, planned load) and conduit in
garages for EV charging, so the challenge highlighted in this post is that of 
retrofitting existing buildings that were not recently constructed. New condo developers will look
to monetize these code requirements by selling charging similar to a granite backsplash upgrade and
apartments will offer EV charging through charging networks or as an additional monthly parking option for renters.

A condo building's units are owned by individuals who form the members of a Home Owner's Association (HOA),
governed by a board elected by the members, and all rights and privileges are granted through laws and
the association's governing documents and rules.

I was mentally prepared for a period of educating decisionmakers and residents, working to
help design a fair approach, and working to implement that policy through the association board, 
but I was not expecting the inertia that yielded "false starts" and decisions to "wait and see."

Interest in EV charging started in 2010, and in 2016 we installed a shared, paid EV charging
amenity for residents to use: there were a few EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) parking
in the building but charging at work, on-the-go, or at other properties.

After reservations started on the Tesla Model 3, interest increased in the community as 
an affordable great product came on the horizon, but it was important to the HOA that any
private charging investments be paid for without long-term costs borne by all owners, to be fair.

At our annual member's meeting in 2019 we finally had enough interest to kick off a project, 
hold an "EV Open House" to educate and inform owners, propose rules, and finally offer reservations
in our first phase _Limited Common EV Charging Policy_, allowing individual owners to have
professionals install charges in the hub-and-spoke charging project.

Often it just takes a few people to voice their opinions, present a reasonable plan,
and help see it through, but it takes hard work, educating the community, and
doing the legwork of finding an electrical engineering firm or electrician that you
can trust.

# Our building's story (by year)

At the time of construction, electric cars were more of a pipe dream than anything
else, so the building's electric plans were designed to support our residential units, 
a set of commercial units, and then the common "house" power required
for the parking garage, integration of the building's emergency diesel backup generator,
and other common areas.

Our building's connected to the grid by a 480Y/277V 3-phase 4-wire system with 2 
switchgears: MDS-1 (residences) rated for 1600 amps and MDS-2 ("house" and commercial) 
rated for 1200 amps. Many of our common hallway and 
garage lights are single-phase 277V fixtures, while residence energy is stepped down to 120/208V, and 
we also have a diesel emergency generator and transfer switch sitting behind a portion of the MDS-2 load.

A majority of our parking spaces were assigned to individual units from the time of
original purchase: there is a table in the Declaration that maps units to "Limited Common" parking
spaces, and a very small number of association-owned common parking spaces for motorcycles or
rental. In condo speak, a "Limited Common" part of the property is a commonly owned portion
of the building available for specific use by a unit. Although parking is not deeded, parking is 
assigned, so any change to the table of parking must be approved and recorded as a 
Declaration Amendment with the county, making changes rather expensive. The association grants
the board of directors the right to approve modifications and changes to the building's common
and limited common elements, such as installing an electric branch circuit to charge a car.

The EV conversation started in 2010, a community charger was added in 2016, and in 2019 a policy
allowing "Limited Common" (individual chargers in owner's parking spaces) was approved and
implemented in 2019, including supporting electrical infrastructure.

> many of these events took place years before I purchased a property in the building,
> so take this all with a grain of salt.

## 2019: Limited Common EV Project

In 2019 information gathered in the previous year was presented in the annual
January meeting, a proposal was posted in March, approved in May, and reservations 
and installations happened through June and September.

### Annual meeting momentum

Leading up to the annual meeting in January 2019, significant legwork done in previous
years meant that we had a very clear vision for what our first private charging project
would look like. This is one meeting per year where a large set of members in the condo
are present to vote on board positions, so a great chance to poll many people and bring
forward priorities for the coming year.

A brief presentation covered the false starts of previous years over the last decade to
land an EV project and:

- presented new information about load and capacity for the building,
- celebrated the success of the community's one shared EV charger amenity, 
- recognized that private charging will be entirely paid for by owners who buy into the project,
- set a range of expected cost per unit from $5,000-$10,000

By a raise of hands, owners were excited about the option finally being considered in
a state to move forward in the year. An outcome of the strong support was a hope to use
monthly meetings to solidify a plan, consult with the rules committee, hold an open house,
and see if owners really were willing to put money down to reserve the limited space in
the anticipated project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Desire to allow reservations to put $$ behind project

### Designing a proposed policy and rule updates

Rule basics
Chose a # of reservations to require before starting
Would invest in a new panel and transformer in the main electric room
Decision to not invest in per-floor sub-panels, would get much too expensive

### XXX combined content copied elsewhere

Peak Demand data for over a year retrieved from the city, associated with the “house” city meter. Could be used to understand the current peak load and available capacity for additional investments. On the 1200A 480V switchgear, peak demand was coming in at around 11% of capacity.
Associate receives a set of quotes around $12,000 to install a new 75 KVA transformer and electric panel dedicated to EV charging. Within the range that the community could offer access to the panel in return for a fee to fund the project.
February, draft policy finalized by the rules committee. Creates a “reservation” program: once enough circuit reservations are in place, the association will greenlight the electrical infrastructure investment to enable the project. Draft policy distributed to the association for review and feedback, rules process requires bake time.
March, policy approved, and infrastructure investment approved contingent on receiving 5 paid circuit reservations out of space for 8
April, 7 reservation payments received. Project green-lit, electricians to being pouring concrete, install transformer and new panel in the main electric room. 1 EV charger installation approved by the board by a paid circuit reservation holder.
May, last reservation fee paid, no more reservations for the first phase of the project. 2 more EV installations approved.
June, additional EV installations approved. 3 EV chargers in active use.
Other owners began finalizing their Tesla reservations. Additional Chevy Volt and Bolt cars seen in the garage. More PHEVs being purchased. The community charger is now being used by 6 owners at various times.

### What finally worked for us (XXX CUT?)

- Fund a community paid amenity charger, a bare minimum offering for our existing EV and PHEV owners
- Using annual meetings to keep the topic fresh, provide a high-level overview of potential approaches, and emphasizing no use of association funds for such a project
- Educating more home owners through “EV open houses”: presenting information on EVs, charging, road trips, available car models, common misconceptions, and what a policy would look like. Having actual car models available for owners to see, ride along in helped.
- The work of the A/C project, allowing owners to install air conditioning in their units, at their cost: this project had many of the same general concerns and resulted in a concise set of rules around the policy, requirements, approved equipment.
- Having a Peak Demand electric meter installed by the city (which the city did at its cost, to enable demand-based pricing) which provided enough information for the authority having jurisdiction over our electrical load to feel comfortable approving a new transformer and dedicated panel for EV charging.
- Offering “circuit reservations” through a non-refundable fee, to be able to approve the policy and project contingent on having enough demonstrated interest to fund the project.

## 2015: Shared community EV charger

As was becoming an annual habit, EV charging would become a topic at the annual
association meeting in January, followed by exploratory follow-up meetings.

In 2015 I purchased a unit in the building and joined in the conversations, eager
to get to know my new neighbors, but also very interested in the benefits that
EV ownership could bring to my commute and lifestyle - many of my coworkers
drove Teslas and so I'd been hooked ever since driving one around campus.

The 2015 EV committee launched and focused on looking at a way to affordably bring both 
a community EV charger to the community and then also provide a path for owners to
install their own chargers, at their own cost.

While talking to owners interested in charging, economics became an interesting
conversation: some owners felt that an EV was about both the environment but also
cost savings vs gasoline, and so that any investment in the capital cost of
infrastructure would diminish that theoretical return. That was a bummer, because
it meant demand was down to 2 owners, not the # of electric vehicles in the garage.

*BMW ReachNow car sharing i3 helped*:
Around this time, BMW also launched an on demand car service in Seattle called ReachNow that
let anyone rent a BMW i3 by the minute, so this made it easy for us to take people on rides
around the neighborhood. For many, it was their first time in an EV, and reactions were
very positive, helping spur interest in at least getting a community charger installed.

Around the same time, the Air Conditioning committe kicked off again, looking to
finally find a way to build a way for owners, at their own cost, to install split A/C
units. Similar conversations (especially around those not familiar with electrical
systems) started up: "will we run out of energy", "is it fair to let others install
something that only benefits them," "what if everyone wants this", etc. It was
good to have these parallel conversations to try and dispell the fear and uncertainty.

One key issue was that we had no known peak load information or load studies for
any of our services: our building has 2 utility drops - 1 being dedicated to residential
units, and the other being house - and this created problems. Installing load study
equipment would require a complete temporary outage to install the load equipment, 
and this would be extremely impactful to homes, so only the "house" and commercial 
service were going to be available for this project.

Proposals:

1. Reallocate 2 unused motorcycle parking spaces to become parking space "EV1", a paid
   amenity: electric car charging by the hour. The best quote from an electrician would
   use an existing penetration into the area which is directly above the main electric room,
   then place a 240V breaker in the existing garage panel, and install an EVSE, for $3,000.
2. On top of proposal 1, allow owners, at their own cost, to have a branch circuit installed
   in the existing garage panel, first-come, first-served. There may only be available
   electric capacity for 1-2 chargers, at which point a more involved project would be needed.
   No association cost.

No immediate decision was made on the proposals, but there was thoughtful discussion over
the coming months.

While the board had the authority to approve an owner to have an electrician install a one-off
charger and circuit in the building, it would not provide a scalable solution to future
owners or interest. There was a lot of concern about "what if this is the last charger the
building could install."

**Shared charger approved**: Approval to install, using association funds as a new amenity, a
shared EVSE for up to $3,000. The bid included providing a sub-meter to monitor energy use, if needed.

**Private charger approach not approved**: Without a plan to allow more people than just 1-2 install
chargers, it was seen as not building a fair enough framework to be scalable.

The installation went swiftly, though we did not realize that the original bid only covered
the installation of a NEMA 15-40 outlet, not an EVSE as well. We ended up having to approve
an additional expense to purchase a NEMA 15-40 ClipperCreek unit.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2019ev/ev1space.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="" />



The cheap approach (by not buying a networked/integrated billing and metering solution) was
that the electric outlet is locked, and so an owner has to check out the key to plug the EVSE in
to the outlet before use, then return the key after using and disconnecting the EVSE.

## 2014-2015: EV survey, committee proposals

By 2014 our building had 2 EV/PHEV cars in it - a Chevy Volt and a Tesla Model S. 
Both of these vehicles were becoming more popular throughout the Pacific
Northwest, and new owners were becoming interested in the convenience of 
being able to charge at home.

An EV committee was formed and began researching options, looking at what
other buildings had done to implement an approach, and try and form a basis
for an association opinion.

A survey of owners in the building learned that in the next several years
there would be interest in charging.

The owner who headed the committee did an amazingly solid job pulling
together resources, trying to identify incentives that might reduce the HOA's
burden, find a cost-effective, scalable solution for charging in the building, and
soliciting information from other buildings and groups that have undergone 
similar projects.

The committee was not always able to get the best information from 
electrical firms in the area, whether they had experience in EV-related work
or not: many would offer quotes contingent on available load, but were
not very forthcoming about how to obtain load information, or what that
might cost. Many electricians are much too busy to accept small projects.

Two proposals were considered:

1. For $17,000, the installation of an integrated EVSE charging system that
   would be a single-port commercial charging unit with integrated billing
   and metering.
2. For $11,000, installing a new 3-pole breaker in the existing switchgear to
   feed a new 75KVA 480-120/208V 3-phase transformer, panel, core drilling to
   another location in the garage concrete, and installing a single 50-amp 208V
   dedicated outlet or EVSE.

The new transformer and panel would be an effective solution that would provide
additional capacity for future EV charging to be installed at owners' individual
cost to their parking spaces.

In July the recommendation to table the project again was made, recognizing that
there was insufficient demand to justify spending community association funds on
the project. (HOA budgets are run very efficiently and unbudgeted investments such
as these electrical infrastructure changes can be hard to justify, since they
only benefit those interested in the new addition.)

A future solution would need to minimize the association investment or focus
just on the amenity angle.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2019ev/meterstack.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="" />

## 2010-2013: Early interest

In 2010 the association spent a lot of time working out cost savings
and efficiency improvements to offset rising utility rates.

As a part of that process, a homeowner who was very interested in the
development of Tesla and EV, and considering a Tesla Roadster, asked
about the association's roadmap to enable EV charging.

The association entertained some early options with electricians, one
of which identified a plan that would bring in new meter stacks into the
building, transformers and other equipment, for over $47,500. It is
unclear in retrospect what the scope of the plan was.

The decision was made that it was too soon to think about charging and the
question was tabled.

In 2012, after a few continued conversations about charging, the
owner who wanted to invest in EV charging decided to sell their unit
in our building and purchase a unit in another downtown condo
building that had an EV charging offering program. They moved,
had a charger installed, and purchased an early Tesla Model S in 2013.

In 2013, the question of allowing owners to install branch circuits
for trickle chargers for exotic cars came up: with easy access to a
120V outlet, owners of super cars could keep the 12V battery alive
between periods of rest for the car. This was not seen as a compelling
enough reason to invest in building out new infrastructure, but it
was understood that an eventual EV charging program might permit 
trickle chargers.

## “Electricity is not green”

pacnw
The Pacific Northwest has very green electricity thanks to the Columbia River, but in Washington we’re not exactly leading the way: thankfully there is an EV infrastructure sales tax exemption in place (expires the end of 2019), and occasional state EV purchase incentives, but we do not have “right to charge” laws like other states have. I think there is more that could be done to reduce the cost of retrofitting and expanding current service, such as having Seattle City Light build an unbiased EV opinion desk or service. This will continue to be important: in Seattle, as of 2017, the electric code requires that new construction (excluding 1- and 2- family houses) must allocate electrical capacity and even panel space for future electric car charging demand. Since this will have a cost to developers, this means all apartment and condo developments will find ways to monetize and make available EV charging in newer properties.
Cheap power - under $0.10/kWh currently (however, year-over-year utility increases in Seattle, especially over the past 5 years, are skyrocketing, so this will probably no longer be the case by 2023)

# Advice to condo owners and boards

> If you are a small condo building (less than 50 units), it’s possible this content may not to you, or if you do not have a large multi-level concrete garage.  
In this section I wanted to cover my advice to boards and individual owners looking to help adopt EV charging options for their buildings. Every association is different, especially in its declarations and other governing documents, and so your experience may vary. Finding a great electrician to be a partner in this project will go a long way.
Will retain
Will attract
Important to some listings / realtors as a community amenity worth mentioning
> A note to board members: you may… have a duty, etc. … always act in the best interest of the association … will need to gather broad support for members not on the board. You can help to encourage and maintain a fair voice. Make your interest clear and only move forward once community …  
> Condo - hard deed / assigned / owned spaces  

## The luxury of of personal charging

Easiest to compare to having in-unit washer/dryer vs coin-operated somewhere in the building
It is not cheap
It will not make sense to many
Is something that will add value to your unit only if a future owner cares about or already has interest in EVs
All of our owners interested in individual charging clearly wanted a 208/240V Level 2 charger, not a level 1, although a Level 1 or load sharing solution probably would make sense, it’s a “luxury” amenity for people right now
Always wake up with a full charge
Can set scheduled start or stop times, Tesla will even pre-condition the cabin etc. on work days

## Understanding electric distribution infrastructure

The typical infrastructure in the city will be:
- The utility’s distribution network (power lines underground or overhead)
- The utility’s transformers will step-down electricity from their distribution lines to your building, typically inside your building’s electric vault or a nearby vault underground under a sidewalk or street
- Your main electric room will have 1 or more electric service connections running from the electric vault to your main building switchgear or switchboard. In our building, we have a 480V 3-phase 4-wire system in place.
- The switchgear will have service disconnects and other bus equipment in place. Attached to the 480V 3-phase breakers will be either 480V panels or step-down transformers. (Our single-phase common lighting in the garage runs at 277V, while most household and general outlets are running at 120V and require a transformer to be useful).
- Unless you have an existing 120/208V panel that has significant spare capacity (*load* available, not physical space) to install new circuit breakers for branch EV circuits, you will need to install a new step-down transformer for your EV charging system project. Our building chose to install a 75KVA transformer as it was the maximum size transformer that could be installed with an over-the-counter (OTC) permit, making the project less expensive and quicker to execute.
- A new panel will be installed that connects to the transformer. This is where the branch connections to individual EV charging circuit owners will be made. Each branch circuit will have a 208/240V circuit breaker as required by their EVSE. If a sub-meter system is being used, a sub-meter will also need to be installed adjacent to the panel for the branch circuit.
- Owners will work with an electrician, and the building manager, to seek approval to have their electrician install, at their own cost, the branch circuit conduit - including any penetrations through concrete, drilling costs, concrete x-rays, mounting the conduit, etc., to their parking spot.
- The electrician would then install the EVSE in the parking space.
From the utility your building will have one or more electric service connections. The utility’s electric vault is where the utility brings in power from the grid.

## Decisions to make

- Do our governing documents (declaration, etc.) allow the community to offer new amenities or approve new uses for Common and Limited Common spaces?
- What is the process for creating a new policy or approving changes to Limited Common parking spaces?
- Whose electric service will be used for the system?
- Do we have sufficient available electric load for the project? Is there data available from the utility? Do we need a load study or plan review? What permit requirements will be made? The outcome of this data will be a few different choices including:
	- If you have a current panel that has spare load and also spare physical capacity for new breakers
	- If you have capacity for the load, but not physical space, and so need a new sub-panel
	- If you have load available from one of your building services, but would need to install a new main breaker, transformer, and panel
	- If your building does not have sufficient electrical service to support your desired new electric charging loads - and would require the utility to bring in new service to your building
- What requirements do we have for contractors?
- How will the association be repaid if its house energy is used?
- Is there enough interest for a community charger?
- Is there significant interest for the community as a whole to invest in infrastructure?
- Is there interest to approve new infrastructure (“hub”) that owners reserve into and allow owners to install at their cost (“spoke”)?
- Do we design a small incremental program, or go big?
- Do we use a charging-as-a-service provider, or install a project that will have monthly port charges?
- Does the program offer Level 1 (120V) and/or Level 2 (208/240V) charging?
- Should installations use a wall connector EVSE system, outlets, or allow either?
- Do we allow owners to use load sharing to install charging in multiple parking spaces of theirs, or make charging available to their parking neighbors?
- Are there specific models or charging systems that need approval?
- Do we need to suggest a location for chargers to be mounted against walls, or pillars, or posts? Do our owners understand the authority having jurisdiction may require the use of bollards or posts or other protective devices?
- How much community money are we willing to invest, if any, in charging that benefits individuals?
- Would we approve using community money in the short term if over the remainder of the specific EV project the community money is completely repaid?
- Do we allow reservation holders to reassign or sell their investment to other owners?
- Do we require reservation holders to install a complete project, or can they wait until the future, or partially install the electric conduit system now?
- What happens when there is demand for additional chargers after the project?
- Do we want to setup a fund for helping with future plans, design or engineering work as the charging problem gets more challenging?
- Do we have wireless Internet in the garage, or do we want to make it available?

## Program outline

Use annual member meetings and surveys to measure broad interest
Setup a committee to investigate implementation details, learn about the local authority’s requirements for installations, load testing, etc.
Host an “EV Open House” or community event for interested owners
Consider installing a community EV charging amenity if your building has available shared/community spaces
Work with the rules and architecture committees to develop a policy framework
Approve a policy contingent on receiving enough financial commitment to fund an infrastructure investment within a set period of time, first-come, first-served
Implement the project and gather feedback
Prepare a summary of advice or notes for the next iteration of the program

## Tips - shared amenity charging

Xyzzy
Do not make it complicated
Have sane rules to allow an overnight charge
Encourage your EV owners to get to know each other and communicate
Consider either using a managed charging system (ChargePoint) or make community charging free
Do not do what we did

## Consider specific circuit breaker sizes

x
People who do not know better will always want “more”, even when they do not need it
Always be charging
Fear and uncertainty
The National Electric Code designates charging stations as a “dedicated continuous load”, which means that 125% of the load needs to be available at the circuit breaker. **This surprises many people, even electricians**. This means that you cannot pack your panel as full as you would like: if you want to install a 32-amp EVSE on a branch circuit, you’ll need to have it wired to a 40-amp circuit breaker; a 40-amp charger will need a 50-amp breaker, etc.
It’s a little unfortunate, since it means you have to over invest in infrastructure to support EV charging. This is also why it’s important to think through how much load you need to provision and the specific size circuit breakers you will be allowing in your installation.

## Approaches to recovering energy costs

City meters
Sub-meter panel
Sub-meter circuits
Fixed monthly cost
Managed charging platforms (i.e. ChargePoint)
Free charging
NOTE that your utility’s specifics may impact this… may have time and demand-based charging rates
NOTE some jurisdictions may not allow you to sub-meter electricity
As of this writing, in Seattle we do not have time-of-day rates
Our “house” circuit does have demand charges based on peak demand

## Tips - individual charging

Do not authorize one-off installations using existing panels
Do consider load sharing and managed service providers if there is significant initial demand
If setting up a community shared charger, price it to encourage use
Think about an efficient and fair chargeback scheme
Consider using a first-come, first-served reservation scheme
Consider specific circuit size limits
Make sure owners are approved by the board and/or building manager and use a licensed, bonded, insured electrician
Make sure owners’ electricians obtain a permit from city and that the work is signed off on by the authority having jurisdiction

## Thinking about load sharing and fleet charging providers

This space will continue to evolve
There are companies offering “charging-as-a-service” products, where they cover the capital infrastructure investment in return for the long-term right to collect monthly service and maintenance income from your building and owners.
Many EVSEs can load share among multiple units
Tesla Wall Connector, for example, can be configured to share power between 4 charging units that are each up to 50 feet apart
In the next decade it’s easy to imagine these large load sharing and power management platforms will be the de-facto approach to handling large fleets of vehicles or large residential garage projects.

## Approaches we did not pursue

- Allowing owners to branch their residential unit’s power and install conduit from that to their parking spaces
- New utility meters dedicated to individual EV chargers

## Resources you can use

PPTX - EV Open House
DOCX sample policy
Tesla letter to condo board

# What other downtown Seattle condos have done

Fancy Tower 1 - E: Community infrastructure, spokes paid by individual owners

Fancy Tower 2 - H: Hub-and-spoke paid for by reservations and individual owners

Our tower: Hub-and-spoke paid for by reservations and individual owners

New fancy tower - I: assigned at purchase time as an upgrade similar to countertops; a set of shared chargers on ChargePoint, too.

Similar Tower 1 - P: Pilot program allowing a single owner to tap into an existing garage panel at their own cost.

Fnacy Tower - O: A single owner invested in electric upgrades and now offers to sell portions of the panel to owners at their cost.

New construction tower - F: Selling EV charging in parking spaces similar to a backsplash or home upgrade at time of sale.

New construction tower - S: Investing in a set of community-shared EV cars that will be available for rent to owners.

Hotel condo tower - M: Valet-assisted charging available

Unfortunate Belltown Tower 1: Not allowing any charging at this time

Unfortunate Belltown Tower 2: Not allowing any charging at this time

Unfortunate Belltown Tower 3: Not allowing any charging at this time

Unfortunate Belltown Tower 4: Not allowing any charging at this time

We are not aware of any downtown Seattle buildings that have invested in broad fleet-style load sharing
infrastructure systems.

# Advice to Washington State policy makers and utilities

> **The State of Washington does not have “right to charge laws”** like some states do (California, Colorado, Florida and Oregon). In California, [Civil Code 4745, 4745.1]([Law section](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4745.&lawCode=CIV)) states that “HOAs may not prohibit or unreasonably restrict the installation or use of electric vehicle charging stations in a designated parking space.” As a result, in Washington there is a strong bias for inaction in Washington condo associations with regard to pilot programs and working to extend EV charging, since no charge is easiest to manage, and in general, and HOA board can simply deny any request. **Washington needs a right-to-charge law** to help accelerate EV adoption by encouraging HOAs to think through how to implement and build a smart program for letting their owners, at their own individual cost, install electric charging equipment in a fair manner, or invest in shared infrastructure.  


Consider right-to-charge laws
Continue with the utility EV adoption programs that Puget Sound Energy has been piloting
Consider extending the expiring 2019 sales tax exemption
Compared to states like California, unfortunately Washington sends a lot of mixed signals
Jeff’s pipe dream: SCL EV green lighting approach: waive, offer load studies, plan review optimizations
SCL to help perform or provide discounts for panel and other load studies
SCL to provide professional experienced advice at no cost

# Electric code sections of note

Pointers-
SCL NEC inserts
SCL EV guides
National Electric Code

# Looking forward

Newer condos are evolving due to code changes they will monetize the required parking spaces they must bring conduit to
Newer buildings in Seattle must have sufficient energy for many spaces to have at least a 20-amp 208/240V Level 2 charger



# Misc
I am not an electrician. I can not be responsible for your community’s approach, even if you chose to take advice from this posting. Consider using professional advice, whether that includes legal advice on new rules and regulations or policies, electrician advice on load studies and planning for panel capacity, etc.
Kudos to everyone who owns a single-family home, it’s often so insanely cheap and easy - $500-$1,000 - to get a licensed electrician and permit to help install EV charging on your existing home service load. Running this project made me think regularly about selling my condo and just buying a home instead.
My biases and notes regarding this project and this post:
- I believe that Level 2 charging (208/240V 20-amp or more current) is a requirement for someone to want to invest thousands of dollars in such a condo project
- I believe private, individual charging is a luxury
- Our condo building, constructed in 2002, has declaration-assigned parking spaces, making the movement of parking spaces very expensive and time consuming, so this favors in-place installations at cost
- Load sharing is great, but our association’s requirement to sub-meter utilities makes it ineffective, at least for our first installation project. (Note, some owners who would like multiple chargers will find load sharing great)
- Charging-as-a-service providers have too many unknowns, especially in how such firms will remain profitable over time, to commit an association to such a contract
I do want to hear if others find this content helpful. Let me know on Twitter!

## The next project: EV2

## The big project: EV3?

The TL;DR version

My $6,000 Tesla Wall Connector: the story of bringing Electric Vehicle charging to my high-rise condo tower in Seattle... essentially a 5-year project.

Timeline

Early interest ; attract, retain

The question about charging started again in 2016 especially after the Model 3 reservations started.

Shared community EV amenity

Our existing garage panel could probably support 1-2 EV branch circuits, but would require a load study, 
and not enough interest. Since it wouldn't benefit everyone, it must land in a way that only owners individually
pay, not the community.

A few years back our "house" service from the utility got a peak demand meter
The utility was able to pull this data to help us secure an over-the-counter permit for new infrastructure
75KVA transformer, 200-amp 120/208V panel
Transformers are amazing

Rules were approved after community feedback pending enough reservations for the project to be in the green.
Happened over a 2-month period.

It's expensive since we have a post-tension concrete 4-level garage, so penetrations that require a core drill 
would need to have imaging done to make sure there's no risk of hitting the PT cables.

Also, parking spaces can be very far away from the main electric room panel, requiring hundreds of feet of
conduit and thick-gauge wire

Along the way, a lot of fear and uncertainty: "I need a huge breaker size", "the car dealer says it will take
days to charge and not to do this", "you always charge from empty to full", ...

In the end it's a great luxury being able to charge an EV at home. When you get home from work, just step out,
hit the button on the Tesla charger, and wake up the next morning with a full charge.

We benefitted from a tax exemption in Washington State on EV infrastructure (no sales tax through end of 2019
on the entire set of infrastructure if used for EV)

Final cost for the community's EV1 project supporting 8 owners' EV charging: $XXX

Final cost for a sample individual: 

As a result there's a lot more interest in EVs, and many people have purchased them recently, 
especially thanks to having access to the shared amenity. We went from 1 Tesla before the project to 6 now 
and growing.
