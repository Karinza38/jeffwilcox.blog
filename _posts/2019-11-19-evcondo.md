After commuting home from the office I carefully park, step out of the car, grab the 
charging cable looped around the Tesla Wall Connector, press the button on the cable, 
and the car's charge port door opens, letting me quickly plug in the car.
I wake up in the morning with the confidence that I can go anywhere I need to: work, 
weekend errands, travel over a nearby mountain pass… yet **getting to this simple experience
took over 4 years. EV charging is an uphill battle in many condo associations**.

Installing an Electric Vehicle Service Equipment (EVSE) for any electric car is straightforward and 
can be done in a single-family home for under $1,000; yet the same installation can easily cost
$5,000+ per port once infrastructure costs are factored in.

The condo tower I live is located in downtown Seattle and was built in 2002, has around 200 units, and 250
parking spaces spread over 4 underground levels. The construction is of post-tensioned concrete 
and steel. The building is served by two 3-phase 480Y/277V service connections to Seattle City Light.

EV installations in large buildings have infrastructure costs that can run into the 5+-figure range, 
assuming the existing service has ample capacity: building-level switchboard work, new transformers 
and panels, running conduit hundreds of feet through multiple levels of post-tensioned concrete). 

<a href="{{ site.cdn }}2019ev/mashup.jpg" target="_new"><img src="{{ site.cdn }}2019ev/mashup.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="Mashup" /></a>

I was mentally prepared for a period of educating decisionmakers and residents, working to
help design a fair approach, and working to implement that policy through the association board, 
but I was not expecting there to be so many "false starts", decisions to "wait and see", and 
board inertia (against change).

Interest in EV charging started in 2010, and in 2016 we installed a shared, paid EV charging
amenity for any resident to use. After the introduction of the Tesla Model 3, interest began
to increase in the community.

At our annual member's meeting in 2019 we finally had enough interest to kick off a project, 
hold an EV open house to inform owners, propose rule changes, and finally offer the first
phase of our "Limited Common EV Charging Policy", allowing individual owners to buy in to a hub-and-spoke 
charging infrastructure project.

> As a result of this project, our association has gone from 2 electric vehicles to
> 9 Electric Vehicles (including plug-in hybrids) during the project: after years of concern
> about a lack of demand, our next question will be how soon to wait until kicking off
> the next phase to install even more chargers.

In this post I wanted to share the experience I had and tips for others. Many EV forums have
anecdotes about condos and apartments but not many end-to-end stories. This set of topics will 
include:

- Our building's EV charging story
- Overcoming fear and uncertainty (common questions and concerns)
- Advice to condo owners and boards
- How Washington State could do better for EVs
- Looking forward
- Resources

I strongly believe that offering EV charging opportunities is key to attracting and retaining forward-looking 
owners in a condo building, and having a charging available to those that want it is a great luxury amenity that 
an individual or entire building can recognize value from.

Home charging is a great luxury.
There are people very interested in an EV who will not invest in such a vehicle until they are certain that
there is a charging routine that will fit with their lifestyle: some can charge on-the-go, or at work, while 
others want the peace of mind of always being connected while parked at home.

Looking to the future, I'm thankful that cities like Seattle are aggressively updating building and 
electric code to require new buildings to run conduit to parking spaces, 
reserving feeder capacity for future electric vehicle infrastructure, and 
encouraging home charging - so the challenge I am highlighting is that of 
retrofitting existing buildings by removing concerns about when and where to charge.

Often it just takes a few people to voice their opinions, present a reasonable plan,
and help see it through.

# Our condo's EV story

A typical Seattle condo building constructed during the 2000-2005 era, the building
houses just under 200 units and is built of modern steel-and-concrete construction. The
concrete is post-tensioned.

At the time of construction, electric cars were more of a pipe dream than anything
else, and so the building was only built to anticipate the load for all of the
residential units, a set of commercial units, and then the common "house" power required
for the parking garage, integration of the building's emergency diesel backup generator,
and other common areas.

Our building is served 3-phase electric (480Y/277V 3-phase 4-wire Wye power system) from
2 services for efficiency. Many of our common hallway and garage lights are single-phase 277V
fixtures, for example. Residence energy is stepped down to 120/208V.

A majority of our parking spaces are assigned to individual units from the time of
original purchase: there is a table in the Declaration that maps units to "Limited Common" parking
spaces, and a very small number of association-owned common parking spaces for motorcycles or
rental.

Although parking is not deeded, parking is assigned, and so any change to the table of
parking must be approved and recorded as a Declaration Amendment with the county, making
changes rather expensive.

Of note to our journey, only 20 units in our building were built with air conditioning (A/C) HVAC
units.. A/C was not very common in Seattle until the most recent development cycle, and it is
rapidly becoming an amenity that many would like in their Seattle homes. In many ways our 
association's member's quest to allow owners to install A/C units after the fact helped to pave
the way for EV charging.

The A/C retrofit topic started in 2006, 4 years after construction, 
and was finally approved in 2016. The EV conversation started in 2010 
and was approved in 2019.

## 2010-2013: Early interest, failed retention

2010

Energy efficient lighting investments (excitement around cost savings, being green, helping with Seattle goals on energy use)
An owner asks about the association’s roadmap for enabling EV charging

2011: Early interest, multiple quotes from electricians

Association receives a quote for $47,500 to build out an electric panel for a few EV chargers
Concerns about expensive electrical projects and who will pay for it, benefiting just a few individuals

2012: Association fails to retain an owner

The owner who was passionate about EV charging sold their unit and purchased at another condo building downtown that had an EV policy and program in place

2013: Exotic car trickle charging question came up

## 2014-2015: EV survey and committee

A new EV committee was created
In a survey, 40% of our owners expressed interest in learning more about electric cars
While a few owners have PHEV hybrids, such as the Chevy Volt, none were interested in spending thousands of dollars to install their own private charger. (Primary reason: seeing an EV as both green, but also a way to save money vs purchasing gas. Any money spent on charging would diminish that return.)
“Wait and see” approach taken after several community meetings

2015: Serious interest

Came up regularly
Techies
Environmentally aware owners
Commuters
House service unknown load
Renewed interest spearheaded by an owner interested in purchasing a Tesla Model S. EV committee starts meeting again.
Jeff moves into the building. A fan of EVs, especially after driving several coworkers’ EVs of various models over the years.
New Air Conditioning committee created to try and find a path forward on allowing owners to install, entirely at their own cost, air conditioning.
New community amenity EV charger proposal submitted, would reallocate 2 motorcycle rental spaces to become a space exclusive for EV charging. A paid amenity, by the hour. Project approved with a budget of ~$3,000. The parking space was physically located above the main electric room.
A $35,000 bid was received to install a new panel and transformer to enable EV charging, but the project was contingent on the electrical load being easily determined. Community was unwilling to invest so much without understanding the actual demand in the building for EV charging.
No load study or peak demand information available.
Committee disbands

Test drives - BMW i3, Tesla Model 3, Volt

Unknown electric load challenge

Concerns around available load
Cannot use residential service
Not able to easily add new city meters - discontinued meter stacks
Commercial Wye 3-phase service

## 2015: Shared community EV amenity

x
Volt
A few Teslas
Converted association-owned motorcycle space into a shared charging spot
We went a little too cheap, going for a lock-and-key method of controlling access
Eventually evolved but did not invest the $$ in something like a ChargePoint system


## 2016: Model 3; A/C project; garage WiFi

Tesla Model 3 unveiled. Several owners in the condo place reservation orders.
Many owners
Monthly meetings

A/C launches
Building only originally had A/C for the top 2 floors
Recognizes individuals want a framework to spend significant sums of their own money to invest in their homes, comfort and right to quiet enjoyment
Authorizes the board to approve modifications to Common and Limited Common elements as authorized by state condo law, declaration and its rules
Significant uptake and thankful owners - over 25 installed
Air Conditioning policy put in place, allowing new AC installs. Sets the foundation for what an EV project might require on rules, insurance, other requirements.

2016: Community WiFi in the garage

Security camera project
Turns out to benefit Tesla world in the future

## 2017-2810: Strong community interest, peak demand meter

Annual meeting of the members: strong desire for EV charging, dissatisfaction from some owners that no policy was even in place to allow people to do so entirely at their own cost.
Peak Demand meter installed by the City of Seattle in our main electric room for the “house” panel that provides power to the parking garages, elevators, common hallways and lobbies and rooms.
Over 30 air conditioning units approved for installation by owners, often at a cost of as much as $15,000. Shows “if you build it, allow it, they will come”

2018: Multiple EV/PHEVs in the building using shared amenity

Significant interest in the Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt by owners.
I finalized my reservation to order a Tesla Model 3 Long Range Performance  car and took delivery, initially charging at my employer and also at the community shared paid amenity in the condo building.
3-4 owners regularly charging
Monthly meetings it would often come up again, especially “why can’t we”

2018: Learning about our available electric load

City records
Working with SCL
SCL law, capacity, plan review, over the counter, etc.

## 2019: EV1 ships to 8 owners

Annual meeting, very strong desire for the community to finally land a policy to allow EV chargers, without community funds used.
Tax benefits to completing the work this calendar year

### Annual meeting momentum

### Desire to allow reservations to put $$ behind project

### Designing a proposed policy and rule updates

Rule basics
Chose a # of reservations to require before starting
Would invest in a new panel and transformer in the main electric room
Decision to not invest in per-floor sub-panels, would get much too expensive

### XXX combined content copied elsewhere

Peak Demand data for over a year retrieved from the city, associated with the “house” city meter. Could be used to understand the current peak load and available capacity for additional investments. On the 1200A 480V switchgear, peak demand was coming in at around 11% of capacity.
Associate receives a set of quotes around $12,000 to install a new 75 KVA transformer and electric panel dedicated to EV charging. Within the range that the community could offer access to the panel in return for a fee to fund the project.
February, draft policy finalized by the rules committee. Creates a “reservation” program: once enough circuit reservations are in place, the association will greenlight the electrical infrastructure investment to enable the project. Draft policy distributed to the association for review and feedback, rules process requires bake time.
March, policy approved, and infrastructure investment approved contingent on receiving 5 paid circuit reservations out of space for 8
April, 7 reservation payments received. Project green-lit, electricians to being pouring concrete, install transformer and new panel in the main electric room. 1 EV charger installation approved by the board by a paid circuit reservation holder.
May, last reservation fee paid, no more reservations for the first phase of the project. 2 more EV installations approved.
June, additional EV installations approved. 3 EV chargers in active use.
Other owners began finalizing their Tesla reservations. Additional Chevy Volt and Bolt cars seen in the garage. More PHEVs being purchased. The community charger is now being used by 6 owners at various times.

### What finally worked for us (XXX CUT?)

- Fund a community paid amenity charger, a bare minimum offering for our existing EV and PHEV owners
- Using annual meetings to keep the topic fresh, provide a high-level overview of potential approaches, and emphasizing no use of association funds for such a project
- Educating more home owners through “EV open houses”: presenting information on EVs, charging, road trips, available car models, common misconceptions, and what a policy would look like. Having actual car models available for owners to see, ride along in helped.
- The work of the A/C project, allowing owners to install air conditioning in their units, at their cost: this project had many of the same general concerns and resulted in a concise set of rules around the policy, requirements, approved equipment.
- Having a Peak Demand electric meter installed by the city (which the city did at its cost, to enable demand-based pricing) which provided enough information for the authority having jurisdiction over our electrical load to feel comfortable approving a new transformer and dedicated panel for EV charging.
- Offering “circuit reservations” through a non-refundable fee, to be able to approve the policy and project contingent on having enough demonstrated interest to fund the project.

Reality is Volt, Bolt, many very affordable electric cars now
Tesla Model 3 changed the conversation significantly

## “Why should our association spend time on this?”

## "Why are we only letting some people benefit"

Limited Common is a key part of any condo

Parking spaces per unit, storage units already 
A/C
Large outdoor patios and decks
Modern electric deadbolts
Installation of a 4th cable/Internet company in the building

The association board is allowed to create new amenities and to approve work in Limited Common space that benefits only some individuals

## “Electricity is not green”

pacnw
The Pacific Northwest has very green electricity thanks to the Columbia River, but in Washington we’re not exactly leading the way: thankfully there is an EV infrastructure sales tax exemption in place (expires the end of 2019), and occasional state EV purchase incentives, but we do not have “right to charge” laws like other states have. I think there is more that could be done to reduce the cost of retrofitting and expanding current service, such as having Seattle City Light build an unbiased EV opinion desk or service. This will continue to be important: in Seattle, as of 2017, the electric code requires that new construction (excluding 1- and 2- family houses) must allocate electrical capacity and even panel space for future electric car charging demand. Since this will have a cost to developers, this means all apartment and condo developments will find ways to monetize and make available EV charging in newer properties.
Cheap power - under $0.10/kWh currently (however, year-over-year utility increases in Seattle, especially over the past 5 years, are skyrocketing, so this will probably no longer be the case by 2023)

# Advice to condo owners and boards

> If you are a small condo building (less than 50 units), it’s possible this content may not to you, or if you do not have a large multi-level concrete garage.  
In this section I wanted to cover my advice to boards and individual owners looking to help adopt EV charging options for their buildings. Every association is different, especially in its declarations and other governing documents, and so your experience may vary. Finding a great electrician to be a partner in this project will go a long way.
Will retain
Will attract
Important to some listings / realtors as a community amenity worth mentioning
> A note to board members: you may… have a duty, etc. … always act in the best interest of the association … will need to gather broad support for members not on the board. You can help to encourage and maintain a fair voice. Make your interest clear and only move forward once community …  
> Condo - hard deed / assigned / owned spaces  

## The luxury of of personal charging

Easiest to compare to having in-unit washer/dryer vs coin-operated somewhere in the building
It is not cheap
It will not make sense to many
Is something that will add value to your unit only if a future owner cares about or already has interest in EVs
All of our owners interested in individual charging clearly wanted a 208/240V Level 2 charger, not a level 1, although a Level 1 or load sharing solution probably would make sense, it’s a “luxury” amenity for people right now
Always wake up with a full charge
Can set scheduled start or stop times, Tesla will even pre-condition the cabin etc. on work days

## Understanding electric distribution infrastructure

The typical infrastructure in the city will be:
- The utility’s distribution network (power lines underground or overhead)
- The utility’s transformers will step-down electricity from their distribution lines to your building, typically inside your building’s electric vault or a nearby vault underground under a sidewalk or street
- Your main electric room will have 1 or more electric service connections running from the electric vault to your main building switchgear or switchboard. In our building, we have a 480V 3-phase 4-wire system in place.
- The switchgear will have service disconnects and other bus equipment in place. Attached to the 480V 3-phase breakers will be either 480V panels or step-down transformers. (Our single-phase common lighting in the garage runs at 277V, while most household and general outlets are running at 120V and require a transformer to be useful).
- Unless you have an existing 120/208V panel that has significant spare capacity (*load* available, not physical space) to install new circuit breakers for branch EV circuits, you will need to install a new step-down transformer for your EV charging system project. Our building chose to install a 75KVA transformer as it was the maximum size transformer that could be installed with an over-the-counter (OTC) permit, making the project less expensive and quicker to execute.
- A new panel will be installed that connects to the transformer. This is where the branch connections to individual EV charging circuit owners will be made. Each branch circuit will have a 208/240V circuit breaker as required by their EVSE. If a sub-meter system is being used, a sub-meter will also need to be installed adjacent to the panel for the branch circuit.
- Owners will work with an electrician, and the building manager, to seek approval to have their electrician install, at their own cost, the branch circuit conduit - including any penetrations through concrete, drilling costs, concrete x-rays, mounting the conduit, etc., to their parking spot.
- The electrician would then install the EVSE in the parking space.
From the utility your building will have one or more electric service connections. The utility’s electric vault is where the utility brings in power from the grid.

## Decisions to make

- Do our governing documents (declaration, etc.) allow the community to offer new amenities or approve new uses for Common and Limited Common spaces?
- What is the process for creating a new policy or approving changes to Limited Common parking spaces?
- Whose electric service will be used for the system?
- Do we have sufficient available electric load for the project? Is there data available from the utility? Do we need a load study or plan review? What permit requirements will be made? The outcome of this data will be a few different choices including:
	- If you have a current panel that has spare load and also spare physical capacity for new breakers
	- If you have capacity for the load, but not physical space, and so need a new sub-panel
	- If you have load available from one of your building services, but would need to install a new main breaker, transformer, and panel
	- If your building does not have sufficient electrical service to support your desired new electric charging loads - and would require the utility to bring in new service to your building
- What requirements do we have for contractors?
- How will the association be repaid if its house energy is used?
- Is there enough interest for a community charger?
- Is there significant interest for the community as a whole to invest in infrastructure?
- Is there interest to approve new infrastructure (“hub”) that owners reserve into and allow owners to install at their cost (“spoke”)?
- Do we design a small incremental program, or go big?
- Do we use a charging-as-a-service provider, or install a project that will have monthly port charges?
- Does the program offer Level 1 (120V) and/or Level 2 (208/240V) charging?
- Should installations use a wall connector EVSE system, outlets, or allow either?
- Do we allow owners to use load sharing to install charging in multiple parking spaces of theirs, or make charging available to their parking neighbors?
- Are there specific models or charging systems that need approval?
- Do we need to suggest a location for chargers to be mounted against walls, or pillars, or posts? Do our owners understand the authority having jurisdiction may require the use of bollards or posts or other protective devices?
- How much community money are we willing to invest, if any, in charging that benefits individuals?
- Would we approve using community money in the short term if over the remainder of the specific EV project the community money is completely repaid?
- Do we allow reservation holders to reassign or sell their investment to other owners?
- Do we require reservation holders to install a complete project, or can they wait until the future, or partially install the electric conduit system now?
- What happens when there is demand for additional chargers after the project?
- Do we want to setup a fund for helping with future plans, design or engineering work as the charging problem gets more challenging?
- Do we have wireless Internet in the garage, or do we want to make it available?

## Program outline

Use annual member meetings and surveys to measure broad interest
Setup a committee to investigate implementation details, learn about the local authority’s requirements for installations, load testing, etc.
Host an “EV Open House” or community event for interested owners
Consider installing a community EV charging amenity if your building has available shared/community spaces
Work with the rules and architecture committees to develop a policy framework
Approve a policy contingent on receiving enough financial commitment to fund an infrastructure investment within a set period of time, first-come, first-served
Implement the project and gather feedback
Prepare a summary of advice or notes for the next iteration of the program

## Tips - shared amenity charging

Xyzzy
Do not make it complicated
Have sane rules to allow an overnight charge
Encourage your EV owners to get to know each other and communicate
Consider either using a managed charging system (ChargePoint) or make community charging free
Do not do what we did

## Consider specific circuit breaker sizes

x
People who do not know better will always want “more”, even when they do not need it
Always be charging
Fear and uncertainty
The National Electric Code designates charging stations as a “dedicated continuous load”, which means that 125% of the load needs to be available at the circuit breaker. **This surprises many people, even electricians**. This means that you cannot pack your panel as full as you would like: if you want to install a 32-amp EVSE on a branch circuit, you’ll need to have it wired to a 40-amp circuit breaker; a 40-amp charger will need a 50-amp breaker, etc.
It’s a little unfortunate, since it means you have to over invest in infrastructure to support EV charging. This is also why it’s important to think through how much load you need to provision and the specific size circuit breakers you will be allowing in your installation.

## EVSEs vs Outlets

x

## 120V vs 208/240V

x

## Approaches to recovering energy costs

City meters
Sub-meter panel
Sub-meter circuits
Fixed monthly cost
Managed charging platforms (i.e. ChargePoint)
Free charging
NOTE that your utility’s specifics may impact this… may have time and demand-based charging rates
NOTE some jurisdictions may not allow you to sub-meter electricity
As of this writing, in Seattle we do not have time-of-day rates
Our “house” circuit does have demand charges based on peak demand

## Tips - individual charging

Do not authorize one-off installations using existing panels
Do consider load sharing and managed service providers if there is significant initial demand
If setting up a community shared charger, price it to encourage use
Think about an efficient and fair chargeback scheme
Consider using a first-come, first-served reservation scheme
Consider specific circuit size limits
Make sure owners are approved by the board and/or building manager and use a licensed, bonded, insured electrician
Make sure owners’ electricians obtain a permit from city and that the work is signed off on by the authority having jurisdiction

## Thinking about load sharing and fleet charging providers

This space will continue to evolve
There are companies offering “charging-as-a-service” products, where they cover the capital infrastructure investment in return for the long-term right to collect monthly service and maintenance income from your building and owners.
Many EVSEs can load share among multiple units
Tesla Wall Connector, for example, can be configured to share power between 4 charging units that are each up to 50 feet apart
In the next decade it’s easy to imagine these large load sharing and power management platforms will be the de-facto approach to handling large fleets of vehicles or large residential garage projects.

## Approaches we did not pursue

- Allowing owners to branch their residential unit’s power and install conduit from that to their parking spaces
- New utility meters dedicated to individual EV chargers

# What other downtown Seattle condos have done

Fancy Tower 1 - E: Community infrastructure, spokes paid by individual owners

Fancy Tower 2 - H: Hub-and-spoke paid for by reservations and individual owners

Our tower: Hub-and-spoke paid for by reservations and individual owners

New fancy tower - I: assigned at purchase time as an upgrade similar to countertops; a set of shared chargers on ChargePoint, too.

Similar Tower 1 - P: Pilot program allowing a single owner to tap into an existing garage panel at their own cost.

Fnacy Tower - O: A single owner invested in electric upgrades and now offers to sell portions of the panel to owners at their cost.

New construction tower - F: Selling EV charging in parking spaces similar to a backsplash or home upgrade at time of sale.

New construction tower - S: Investing in a set of community-shared EV cars that will be available for rent to owners.

Hotel condo tower - M: Valet-assisted charging available

Unfortunate Belltown Tower 1: Not allowing any charging at this time

Unfortunate Belltown Tower 2: Not allowing any charging at this time

Unfortunate Belltown Tower 3: Not allowing any charging at this time

Unfortunate Belltown Tower 4: Not allowing any charging at this time

We are not aware of any downtown Seattle buildings that have invested in broad fleet-style load sharing
infrastructure systems.

# Advice to Washington State policy makers and utilities

> **The State of Washington does not have “right to charge laws”** like some states do (California, Colorado, Florida and Oregon). In California, [Civil Code 4745, 4745.1]([Law section](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4745.&lawCode=CIV)) states that “HOAs may not prohibit or unreasonably restrict the installation or use of electric vehicle charging stations in a designated parking space.” As a result, in Washington there is a strong bias for inaction in Washington condo associations with regard to pilot programs and working to extend EV charging, since no charge is easiest to manage, and in general, and HOA board can simply deny any request. **Washington needs a right-to-charge law** to help accelerate EV adoption by encouraging HOAs to think through how to implement and build a smart program for letting their owners, at their own individual cost, install electric charging equipment in a fair manner, or invest in shared infrastructure.  


Consider right-to-charge laws
Continue with the utility EV adoption programs that Puget Sound Energy has been piloting
Consider extending the expiring 2019 sales tax exemption
Compared to states like California, unfortunately Washington sends a lot of mixed signals
Jeff’s pipe dream: SCL EV green lighting approach: waive, offer load studies, plan review optimizations
SCL to help perform or provide discounts for panel and other load studies
SCL to provide professional experienced advice at no cost

# Electric code sections of note

Pointers-
SCL NEC inserts
SCL EV guides
National Electric Code

# Looking forward

Newer condos are evolving due to code changes they will monetize the required parking spaces they must bring conduit to
Newer buildings in Seattle must have sufficient energy for many spaces to have at least a 20-amp 208/240V Level 2 charger

I am not an electrician. I can not be responsible for your community’s approach, even if you chose to take advice from this posting. Consider using professional advice, whether that includes legal advice on new rules and regulations or policies, electrician advice on load studies and planning for panel capacity, etc.
Kudos to everyone who owns a single-family home, it’s often so insanely cheap and easy - $500-$1,000 - to get a licensed electrician and permit to help install EV charging on your existing home service load. Running this project made me think regularly about selling my condo and just buying a home instead.
My biases and notes regarding this project and this post:
- I believe that Level 2 charging (208/240V 20-amp or more current) is a requirement for someone to want to invest thousands of dollars in such a condo project
- I believe private, individual charging is a luxury
- Our condo building, constructed in 2002, has declaration-assigned parking spaces, making the movement of parking spaces very expensive and time consuming, so this favors in-place installations at cost
- Load sharing is great, but our association’s requirement to sub-meter utilities makes it ineffective, at least for our first installation project. (Note, some owners who would like multiple chargers will find load sharing great)
- Charging-as-a-service providers have too many unknowns, especially in how such firms will remain profitable over time, to commit an association to such a contract
I do want to hear if others find this content helpful. Let me know on Twitter!

The TL;DR version

My $6,000 Tesla Wall Connector: the story of bringing Electric Vehicle charging to my high-rise condo tower in Seattle... essentially a 5-year project.

Timeline

Early interest ; attract, retain

The question about charging started again in 2016 especially after the Model 3 reservations started.

Shared community EV amenity

Our existing garage panel could probably support 1-2 EV branch circuits, but would require a load study, 
and not enough interest. Since it wouldn't benefit everyone, it must land in a way that only owners individually
pay, not the community.

A few years back our "house" service from the utility got a peak demand meter
The utility was able to pull this data to help us secure an over-the-counter permit for new infrastructure
75KVA transformer, 200-amp 120/208V panel
Transformers are amazing

Rules were approved after community feedback pending enough reservations for the project to be in the green.
Happened over a 2-month period.

It's expensive since we have a post-tension concrete 4-level garage, so penetrations that require a core drill 
would need to have imaging done to make sure there's no risk of hitting the PT cables.

Also, parking spaces can be very far away from the main electric room panel, requiring hundreds of feet of
conduit and thick-gauge wire

Along the way, a lot of fear and uncertainty: "I need a huge breaker size", "the car dealer says it will take
days to charge and not to do this", "you always charge from empty to full", ...

In the end it's a great luxury being able to charge an EV at home. When you get home from work, just step out,
hit the button on the Tesla charger, and wake up the next morning with a full charge.

We benefitted from a tax exemption in Washington State on EV infrastructure (no sales tax through end of 2019
on the entire set of infrastructure if used for EV)

Final cost for the community's EV1 project supporting 8 owners' EV charging: $XXX

Final cost for a sample individual: 

As a result there's a lot more interest in EVs, and many people have purchased them recently, 
especially thanks to having access to the shared amenity. We went from 1 Tesla before the project to 6 now 
and growing.
