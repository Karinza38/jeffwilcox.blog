<p>Visual Studio 2008 Team System installed in 3 minutes. Thank you Intel!</p>

<p>I’ve been hearing so much about the higher-end Solid State Disks that are out there on the market. Like a virus, it is slowly infecting more and more people. This past week, I made the jump and picked up an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F4YIYY?ie=UTF8&tag=jwilcoxblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001F4YIYY">Intel X25-M 80GB SSD</a> drive to replace the 10,000 rpm Raptor drive in my primary workstation at home.</p>

<p>So far, it’s been worth every penny – and then some. I did <a href="http://anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=3403&p=1">some reading</a> before making the jump and was skeptical; effectively this Intel MLC drive offers write speeds along the same lines as a 10K hard drive, but with random read speeds around 250 MB/s. Goodbye defrag!</p>

<p>Anyway, the experience for so many of the operations that I do daily (disk-bound builds, multi-tasking, exploring the jungle that is Outlook) is just an insane improvement.</p>

<p>Since I’m installing a new build of Windows 7 every few days, I’m getting pretty familiar with application setup dialogs.</p>

<p>Here’s my unscientific take (watching the Windows clock) on application install times. They’re installed over my gigabit home network, from a local file server – obviously these are not typical results:</p>

    </tr>

      <td valign="top" width="325">Office 2007</td>

      <td valign="top" width="325">2 minutes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

<p>Of course, this is on top of a very powerful Intel workstation (45nm extreme proc, 1333fsb, DDR3). Anyone out there have good or bad experiences with similar hardware? Is this a new wave of innovation and developer efficiency?</p>

<p><em>Yes, this is the infamous “Jeff hardware budget” that is a little unrealistic. I sure do hope that the prices come down soon so that I can swap out all my old-school hard drives with SSD… but this hard drive does cost as much as a Netbook.</em></p>
