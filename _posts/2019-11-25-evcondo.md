*After commuting home from the office I carefully park, step out of the car, grab the 
charging cable looped around the Tesla Wall Connector, press the button on the cable, 
and the car's charge port door opens, letting me quickly plug in the car.
I wake up in the morning with the confidence that I can go anywhere I need to: work, 
weekend errands, travel over a nearby mountain pass…yet **getting to this basic routine
took over 4 years. EV charging can be an uphill battle in many condo associations**.
Without a clear path to charging at home, I wouldn't have placed an order for a
Tesla and would still be driving a German sports car.*

# Overview

Our EV conversation started in 2010, a community charger was added in 2016, and in 2019 a policy
allowing "Limited Common" (individual chargers in owner's parking spaces) was approved and
implemented in 2019, including installing new electric infrastructure.

Installing Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) for any electric car is straightforward and 
can often be done in a single-family home garage for under $700, including an electric permit and inspection;
yet an EVSE install in a large multi-family building can easily cost $3,000-10,000 or more per 
port once electric infrastructure costs, wire, long conduit runs, and core drilling costs are factored in.

The downtown Seattle condo tower I live in was constructed in 2002 and has 200 units, 250
parking spaces in 4 underground levels, constructed of steel and post-tensioned concrete. We
have gigabit community WiFi in the garage which is great for getting Tesla software updates.

The building's electricity is 3-phase 480Y/277V AC served by Seattle City Light. Even if a building 
like ours has sufficient remaining capacity to support charging loads without a larger
utiliy transformer, preparing for many Electric Vehicle (EV) charging installations can get
expensive: there may be a need for switchgear work, breakers, step-down transformers,
new panels or sub-panels, running conduit hundreds of feet through multiple levels of concrete).

Washington State is _not_ a "right-to-charge" state, so there is no law requiring an
apartment or condo to allow EV charging. The [Seattle Electric Code](http://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes-we-enforce-(a-z)/electrical-code) (2014, 2017)
is requiring new buildings to provision capacity (feeders, panel space, planned load) and conduit in
garages for EV charging, so the challenge highlighted in this post is that of 
retrofitting existing buildings that were not recently constructed. New condo developers will look
to monetize these code requirements by selling charging similar to a granite backsplash upgrade and
apartments will offer EV charging through charging networks or as an additional monthly parking option for renters.

A condo building's units are owned by individuals who form the members of a Home Owner's Association (HOA),
governed by a board elected by the members, and all rights and privileges are granted through laws and
the association's governing documents and rules.

I was mentally prepared for a period of educating decisionmakers and residents, working to
help design a fair approach, and working to implement that policy through the association board, 
but I was not expecting the inertia that yielded "false starts" and decisions to "wait and see."

After reservations started on the Tesla Model 3, interest increased in the community as 
an affordable great product came on the horizon, but it was important to the HOA that any
private charging investments be paid for without long-term costs borne by all owners, to be fair.

At our annual member's meeting in 2019 we finally had enough interest to kick off a project, 
hold an "EV Open House" to educate and inform owners, propose rules, and finally offer reservations
in our first phase _Limited Common EV Charging Policy_, allowing individual owners to have
professionals install charges in the hub-and-spoke charging project.

Often it just takes a few people to voice their opinions, present a reasonable plan,
and help see it through, but it takes hard work, educating the community, and
doing the legwork of finding an electrical engineering firm or electrician that you
can trust.

# Limited Common charging (2019)

In 2019 information gathered in the previous year was presented in the annual
January meeting, a proposal was posted in March, approved in May, and reservations 
and installations happened through June and September by our first round of 8 owners
who reserved circuits in the infrastructure.

The culmination of years of work,

- Electric capacity and required infrastructure needed to be identified, including quotes/bids
- Sufficient committed demand had to be identified to greenlight a project that would have no
  long-term cost borne by the association
- A policy to cover association requirements for installations, contractors, edge cases had
  to be drafted, brought to the board for the required notice period, and implemented

## Available electric capacity

At the time of our building's construction, electric cars were a pipe dream (GM's EV-1 was California only), 
so the building's electric plans were designed to support just residential units
and building systems. The garage wasn't wired with spare circuits in its slabs beyond 
a few 120-volt outlets anticipated for maintenance.

Our building's connected to the grid by a 480Y/277V 3-phase 4-wire system with 2 
switchgears: MDS-1 up to 1600 amps and MDS-2 up to 1200 amps.

Many of our common hallway and garage lights are single-phase 277V fixtures, while 
residences use energy stepped down to 120/208V, and we also have a diesel emergency 
generator and transfer switch sitting behind a portion of the MDS-2 load.

Having two separate switchgear turns out to be a significant positive development:

- MDS-1 switchgear (residential units) was designed for the building's residential load and
  any additional load would require load studies, plan review, potentially auditing appliances
  and other use of all units, and adding new equipment to the switchgear would require turning
  off power to all residential units for a few hours. Attached to this are a set of transformers
  and all the individual utility meters for units.
- MDS-2 (house/commercial) provides 480-volt and 277-volt electricity to a core set of lights 
  and elevators backed up by a diesel emergency generator, and then also additional lights
  in common areas such as hallways, the lobby, exterior lighting. Thanks to the utility's data
  from its Peak Demand Meter, we learned that over the past several years, it is using at most
  11% of its available capacity. _Perfect candidate to add EV infrastructure to without impacting
  residential units._

If we had not identified such a place, we would have had to work with the utility to
bring in additional service, enlarge existing service, update switchgear with new breakers,
etc. A risk with a larger utility transformer can be fees if you do not end up utilizing the
new capacity sufficiently.

We also learned that we could use the peak demand data to work with inspectors to install
the largest sized transformer and amperage panel that an over-the-counter (OTC) permit could
allow to minimize engineering, electric load study or plan review requirements (likely
not required with an OTC permit).

To accomodate a group of up to 10 chargers (depending on the amperage of the EVSEs planned), we
would need:

- a new 3-phase 480Y/277V breaker installed in the MDS-2 switchgear
- a 75KVA transformer to step down the power to 120/208V
- a new electric panel dedicated to this set of EV branch circuits
- an over-the-counter permit for the work and to have the authority having jurisdiction inspect and approve the install

We received and reviewed bids and different approaches. It was determined that there was
sufficient space inside the main electric room, which is on one of the garage levels, for
this phase of the project.

## Hub/spoke decision

Except for the 3 parking spaces that the association owns for staff use, all other parking
spaces are assigned to individual units. The assignment is made in a table in the 
declaration document that allocates units to "Limited Common" resources like parking, 
unit balconies, and storage. In condo speak, a Limited Common part of the property is 
commonly owned by the building but is intended for use by a specific 1 or more units. 
Parking spaces can be reassigned and sold between owners, though this requires a declaration
ammendment and recording with the county, so can be expensive.

It was determined that an EV project would be significantly cheaper for all owners if a 
single row of chargers was installed, but asking owners to have to reassign spaces to 
accomplish this goal would be a non-starter and halt the process as the "value" of parking
spaces could dramatically change from the original assignments.

A "spoke" model was decided upon: from the new panel's location, those who reserved circuits
in the panel would be responsible for hiring a licensed, bonded, insured electrician to
install the spoke from a circuit breaker in the panel to conduit mounted on the concrete ceilings
and then to the EVSE units. This would be the entire responsibility of the owner who would
need to hold harmless the association from the work. In return, they would be granted approval
from the association board for the installation in common and limited common, subject to
the policy.

## Annual meeting momentum

Leading up to the annual meeting in January 2019, significant legwork done in previous
years meant that we had a very clear vision for what our first private charging project
would look like. This is one meeting per year where a large set of members in the condo
are present to vote on board positions, so a great chance to poll many people and bring
forward priorities for the coming year.

A brief presentation covered the false starts of the past decade (EV charging had come up
at almost every annual meeting for 4 years) to propose an EV project:

- presented new information about load and capacity for the building and being able to use MDS-2,
- celebrated the success of the community's one shared EV charger amenity, 
- recognized that private charging will be entirely paid for by owners who buy into the project,
- set a range of expected cost per unit from $5,000-$10,000

By a raise of hands, owners were excited about the option finally being considered in
a state to move forward in the year. Since there were many details to figure out, this
was about taking the temperature of a large group of owners, not about a motion or
specific plan.

An outcome of the strong support was a hope to use monthly meetings to solidify a plan, 
consult with the rules committee, hold an open house, and see if owners really were willing 
to put money down to reserve the limited space in the anticipated project.

### EV Open House and Tour

## Reservations

Past attempts in the building had always had to deal with the chicken-and-egg problem of
EV ownership: without a clear path to charging in the building, very few people owned
EVs.

After the association installed the shared charger in 2016, there was an uptick in
EV ownership, but only to 2-3 vehicles, only 1 owner which wanted to have the right
to spend their own money on installing a private charger.

With a desire to keep not have the community contributing to the private charging project,
the compromise was that a policy, contingent on a sufficient number of reservations, would
be approved. Reservations would be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis for
cicuits, and be refundable only if the project is not approved.

The price of reservations was set slightly higher than the anticipated cost of a share
of the infrastructure work, so that if all available circuits were reserved, the project
would be fully funded by the owners, and a small surplus of money could be saved in an
account for future EV project planning.

The board, taking community input, decided that if 5 reservations were placed, they
would approve the project.

The rules would also be crafted to recognize that if an owner decided not to install
a circuit, they could transfer the reservation to another owner, to encourage potential
EV owners to buy in to the project.

## Sub-meters

Our association's declaration document is clear that for additional utility installations,
sub-meters can and should be used.

To be most fair, and only charge owners for their energy used, it was decided that
participants in the EV charging project must have a specific revenue-grade sub-meter 
product installed adjacent to the electric panel to record the individual circuit's
energy use.

Quarterly, our staff or management company would read the meters and charge units for
the net new energy used, at cost.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2019ev/submeters.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="" />

_A sub-meter adds around $1,000 to the installation cost of each spoke circuit. If
our declaration had been worded differently, we likely would not have required sub-meters
and instead considered other approaches that other buildings have used. However, this
was the most fair to the owners and board at the time of the decision._

## Fees for ongoing use

Our condo already has several paid amenities, such as guest suites, and so regularly collects
payment by credit card and check for a number of different fees and fines defined by the rules
and policies.

The three fees eventually agreed upon for the project were:

1. The one-time, non-refundable reservation fee to have a circuit assigned in the project.
2. An annual fee of $50 to cover the minimal overhead of the project
  - Quarterly meter reading by our staff, and processing of payments
  - Any credit card fees associated with energy reimbursement
3. Quarterly energy reimbursement

## Level 2 EVSEs, not outlets

In electric vehicle charging, there are 3 commonly recognized levels of charging:

- Level 1 charging is a standard 120V 15-amp or 20-amp circuit that trickle charges
- Level 2 charging is the home charging standard, 208/240V 20-amp or more circuit
- Level 3 charging is DC fast charging, Tesla Supercharger, etc., which would be insanely expensive to install in a private residence

Given this EV project was targeting early adopters, those willing to invest in the infrastructure, 
and likely costing thousands of dollars, we decided that the project will target up to
10 Level 2 chargers. While owners would be allowed to install a Level 1 charger if they wanted,
or a trickle charger for an exotic car, they would not be the primary target of the program.

The electric code requirements for garages such as ours indicates that an outlet (120V, 240V, etc.)
must now be installed on a circuit with ground protection, as they may be exposed to the
wet elements.

Considering the grounding requirement and also that charging stations are much more clean than
having mobile charging connectors around, we decided that our 240V installations must all be of
an approved EVSE model, and not an outlet. Outlets would only be allowed for a Level 1 trickle charger.

## Specific breaker sizes

To maximize the use of the new infrastructure, there was a need to compromise some on
the size of circuit breakers (thereby setting the size of the EVSE units owners could install).

The National Electric Code designates that an electric vehicle circuit be treated like
a continuous load, so there is a 125% buffer requirement on the load: a 40-amp EV charger
needs to be installed with a 50-amp circuit breaker, an 80-amp circuit would need a 100-amp
breaker, etc.

In new single-family home installs, Tesla, Audi e-Ton, and other high-end EVs often opt
for the largest circuit their panel can support, to maximize the charging, and "because
the numbers are big and cool."

The reality is that an EV is rarely charging an empty battery - in common daily use, it's
just topping off the battery over a few hours from that day's drive. The acceptance rate
of many EVs is also not always high enough to support large breaker sizes. The 
cost of wire and size of conduit increase as the 208/240V amperage goes up, too.

The City of Seattle designates that a Level 2 EV charger is one that is 20-amps or more.
With a 20-amp charger and a regional daily commute, a typical EV would be able to recharge
for that commute in 3-5 hours, easily overnight, so we decided to accept the city's minimum
Level 2 designation as the baseline.

If enough owners were OK with a 20-amp charger on a 25-amp circuit breaker, we would
get more charging circuits out of the project.

We set the reservation prices at:

- $1,000 for a 20-amp EVSE (25-amp circuit breaker)
- $2,000 for a 32-amp EVSE (40-amp circuit breaker)

We decided not to offer larger breaker sizes in this project to
maximize participation:

- 40-amp EVSE on a 50-amp circuit (a very common EV circuit size)
- 50-amp, 60-amp and 80-amp (not necessary unless load sharing among multiple chargers)

There's a lot of FUD from people less familiar with EVs - especially Audi dealers -
that you need to have the largest size installation, otherwise "your e-tron will take
days to charge."

## Cost breakdown

### Infrastructure cost

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2019ev/transformerpad.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="" />

The best bid that we had on this project was as follows:

- $10,900
  - Purchase an electrical permit and have the work inspected/signed-off by the authority having jurisdiction
  - Pre-inspection review of project
  - Purchase and install a switchgear breaker
  - Provide and install a 75KVA transformer
  - Form and pour a housekeeping pad for the transformer
  - Provide and install a 200-amp main breaker 3-phase 4-wire panel
- $300
  - Provide and install 7 2P-40A and 1 2P-25A breakers

Total of just over $11,000. There was no sales tax thanks to a Washington State 
EV infrastructure exemption. Originally set to expire in 2019, it's since been 
extended into 2025.

### Individual cost

This was the cost of my installation, about 250' from the main electric room.

- $2,000
  - Circuit reservation fee paid to the association to buy into the shared infrastructure project
- $549 EVSE
  - Tesla Wall Connector
- $3,500 Electrician Services
  - Wire in a 120/208V 1-phase 32-amp feed from the new EV1 panel to the specific parking column using 3/4" EMT conduit
  - Install a 60-amp HD disconnect on the feed ahead of the car charger (optional)
  - Wire in and configure an owner-provided Tesla Wall Connector
  - Provide and install an electric deduct meter adjacent to the panel to monitor car charging power
  - Purchase an electrical permit and have the work inspected/signed-off

Total cost of $6,049. No sales tax thanks to 2019 EV infrastructure exemption.

## Contingent policy approved

In one of the early meetings of the year the rules committee presented a proposed policy and
updates to the fees/fines table to cover the new project.

Following the standard review period, in the May association meeting the policy and rules
were unanimously approved by the board and so the project entered the phase of waiting for
sufficient paid reservations.

Owners were strongly encouraged to get quotes from multiple electricians as part
of determining whether they wanted to participate in the program. Interestingly, very
few of the owners believed the initial quotes that installs could be "$5,000 or so". In
hindsight, we should have required that owners provided at least 1 quote to show that
they were very serious about the project and aware of the potential costs involved
in building out their spoke of the system.

In the month following the approval, 5 owners paid the reservation fee, and the board
approved the electric infrastructure upgrades. The cost of the upgrades was around $11,000,
and with 5 owners reserved (4x 32-amp chargers and 1x 20-amp charger), the associated had
received $9,000, and once the additional reservations were sold, the project would have a
surplus.

## Construction begins

In late April the electricians were on site. They pulled a permit from the city and
then schedule a pre-install inspection to meet with the inspector, discuss the project
approach, share the load data and other information, to make sure there would be no
roadblocks along the way for this straightforward project.

Following the inspector meeting the crew started preparing the concrete housekeeping pad
for the new transformer, making preparations and ordering parts.

The electricians also walked the garage with owners who had placed reservations to
offer quotes for their spoke installs. While our owners were free to solicit any licensed,
bonded, and insured electrician, many chose to work with the same firm performing the hub
installation.

## Planned power outage

Installing the new breaker in the switchgear required shutting down power to
other portions of the garage and commercial area.

This turned into a great opportunity to test the building's diesel generator emergency
circuits, learn what systems worked as expected, and what did not. While we do
a quarterly generator test, these use a simulated transfer switch, and not an actual
transfer of the electric load off of the utility grid.

Planned for 3:00am on a specific day to minimize impact, power was turned off
and it was fun seeing the emergency garage lights stay on, the elevators
continue to function, etc., once the diesel generator clicked on. We worked
with our on-site building manager to walk the facility and record systems of
note that were not functioning as expected, or on the wrong circuit, so it was
the first real test since the building opened to occupants over 15 years ago.

Since the switchgear where the infrastructure was being connected is separate
from the residential systems, no residential units lost electricity, and while
we warned residents of the planned outage, we were confident they would not
be impacted.

## Project completion

In May, we received our 8th reservation check and the board closed the project
to new reservations. Our treasurer setup a new account dedicated to future EV
projects with the proceeds.

Several of the owners went forward with ordering new cars such as the Tesla Model 3
and taking delivery.

Circuits were installed throughout the garage; some were wired to EVSEs right away,
one was wired for a trickle charger today and also wire for a future Level 2 charger,
and a few had conduit installed with pull string but no wire for in anticipation of
the owner taking eventual delivery in 2020 or 2021 of an Audi they wanted to wait on.

In the garage we now see several Teslas, another Chevy Volt, a Chevy Bolt, and the 
community charger is now being used by 6 owners at various times who chose not
to invest in the Limited Common charging project.

## Retrospective learnings

In retrospect, if we were to revisit this project again, we may want to take
more information we have learned and consider alternative options.

### Per-circuit sub-meters are expensive

Our community felt strongly that not only should the cost of the project
for private charging be covered exclusively by the individuals benefitting, but
similar to energy use at home, energy use should be metered and paid for by
the individuals.

In some buildings it may be possible to add new meter stacks with utility
meters and separate bills, but since we used the "house meter" from the city,
this meant that the options were:

- Put a single sub-meter on the entire EV panel, and evenly split the cost of energy used by all 8 participants
- Place sub-meters on each EV circuit, having that individual owner reimbuse for their specific use
- Estimate average energy use of an EV on a monthly basis and make this a flat, fixed rate fee for the EV circuits
- Make charging free

In retrospect, **a single sub-meter split evenly** feels like a better approach, since it would have saved
each charger close to $1,000 by not having to have a sub-meter purchased and installed. However, it then
means that users are not directly paying for their energy use.

### Owners do not believe their install cost will be so expensive

Several owners paid the reservation fee but did not believe the estimate of "maybe $5,000 or more"
for the cost of installing their circuit. Even after multiple quotes from electricians, at least 1
of the owners who purchased a reservation has realized it's beyond their comfort level to pay
on top of the cost of a vehicle, etc.

As a result, these owners are now looking to transfer/resell their reservation, or figure out
what to do. We should have required that owners submit a quote along with their reservation to
indicate they do understand their specific costs.

### Disconnect switches not needed

For specific amperages on the higher end, the NEC requires a heavy duty disconnect
switch to be installed. This is not required for 32-amp or even 40-amp installations (I think
it is only at 50 amp+ that it is needed).

When I had my install done, I requested the disconnect switch as part of my quote, which
cost probably another $400 or so in parts and time. This came from my previous research
into the higher amperage chargers when I had considered having a 50-amp charger put in prior
to our decision to reduce target amperage to get more participants in the project.

Our other installs have not gone with a disconnect switch to save cost.

A disconnect switch can allow the owner to lock the switch in the open position (not energized), to disallow access to the charging station by others. Since our panel is located in the locked electric room, this is
a decent approach.

### Continuous load impact on charger count

Our earliest EV committees had estimated incorrectly the load for a given
set of chargers, either by not properly estimating the continuous load
and buffer (people assuming a 20-amp charger only requires 20-amps of 
capacity in the fededers, when really it requires a 25-amp breaker), 
or not estimating the per-phase load.

Make sure to have your electrician clearly indicate available capacity
for chargers, since you do not want to expect to be able to install
more chargers than you can if you are taking reservation payments!

### 6th Service Disconnect

Our "house" service in the switchgear had 5 service disconnect breakers
attached to it before our project, and so our new breaker for the new
transformer became the 6th service disconnect.

The code limits such a setup to 6 service disconnects, so when our
next phases kick off, the electricians will have a slightly increased
project scope to reconfigure the breakers to support additional transformers
or panels without adding a new service-level disconnect.

This was learned during the project and we did not understand before. It
will probably add $2,000-$5,000 to the next phase, if that happens.

# Program preparations (2016-2018)

For several years the topic of EV charging would come up at each annual
meeting and throughout monthly meetings every once and a while. There
was a significant amount of planning that went into running through
options and scenarios.

## Peak demand meter

In late 2017 our building's "house meter" was updated to be a peak demand
meter to allow the city to charge us not only for energy consumed, but also
peak energy consumption.

A nice side effect of this was that we were able to greenlight our 2019
project without requiring a demand study, since the peak demand data from
the meter gave us over 1 entire year of peak data. It indicated that our
house panel was using at peak only 11% of its available electrical capacity,
providing plenty of overhead for our project that an inspector could
agree with.

## Microfilm building records

Many of our original electric drawings (the "as-builts") for the condo
have gone missing over the years as many contractors have borrowed pages
for different purposes.

The City of Seattle maintains archival copies of all these as-builts in
the municipal tower, but for buildings built before a more recent time,
all the records are on microfilm.

We were able to locate the necessary electrical plans to make copies 
and scan for future use. This helped provide a good foundation for
our electricians to review and have handy throughout our EV journey,
although the clarity and quality of some of the figures in the
plans is very hard to read in the film prints.

## Annual community interest

At both the 2017 and 2018 annual meetings held in early January 
owners asked why progress was not being made on investigating a plan
or policy for EV charging. It was clear that a few people would
need to go get involved in learning about the real options.

## Air Conditioning policy

When our building was constructed, only the top 2 floors of the tower
offered HVAC air conditioning. All other units did not have air
conditioning.

A/C was not common in a majority of Seattle homes until more recently,
so this building being built in 2002 did not see A/C as a major feature.

Since then, the condo market has evolved, and more people expect to
have A/C charging for the month or so of warmth each summer, so owners
had asked a lot about how to go about installing charging capabilities.

Similar to the EV project, every year or two, people would ask about A/C,
and conversations started as early at 2005. A decade later, by 2016, there
was finally a policy that would allow a specific set of requirements to be
met in order to mount A/C split units on Limited Common balconies.

This policy and managing the fear and uncertainty during the process helped
forge a good foundation for a similar approach for our EV project.

Additionally, the A/C project clearly defined that there was a path to
owners paying, at their own cost, for a professional to make an 
improvement that only benefits some owners. Installs easily cost as
much as $15,000 and demonstrated that if you provide a path and framework
for people, with a policy, they will appreciate it.

# Community charging amenity (2015)

As was becoming an annual habit, EV charging would become a topic at the annual
association meeting in January, followed by exploratory follow-up meetings.

The 2015 EV committee launched and focused on looking at a way to affordably bring both 
a community EV charger to the community and then also provide a path for owners to
install their own chargers, at their own cost.

In 2015 I purchased a unit in the building and joined in the conversations and 
learned what the committee had been doing, eager to get to know my new neighbors, but 
also very interested in the benefits that EV ownership could bring to my commute and 
lifestyle - many of my coworkers drove Teslas and so I'd been hooked ever since driving 
one around campus.

While talking to owners interested in charging, economics became an interesting
conversation: some owners felt that an EV was about both the environment but also
cost savings vs gasoline, and so that any investment in the capital cost of
infrastructure would diminish that theoretical return. That was a bummer, because
it meant demand was down to 2 owners, not the # of electric vehicles in the garage.

*BMW ReachNow car sharing i3 helped*:
Around this time, BMW also launched an on demand car service in Seattle called ReachNow that
let anyone rent a BMW i3 by the minute, so this made it easy for us to take people on rides
around the neighborhood. For many, it was their first time in an EV, and reactions were
very positive, helping spur interest in at least getting a community charger installed.

Around the same time, the Air Conditioning committe kicked off again, looking to
finally find a way to build a way for owners, at their own cost, to install split A/C
units. Similar conversations (especially around those not familiar with electrical
systems) started up: "will we run out of energy", "is it fair to let others install
something that only benefits them," "what if everyone wants this", etc. It was
good to have these parallel conversations to try and dispell the fear and uncertainty.

One key issue was that we had no known peak load information or load studies for
any of our services: our building has 2 utility drops - 1 being dedicated to residential
units, and the other being house - and this created problems. Installing load study
equipment would require a complete temporary outage to install the load equipment, 
and this would be extremely impactful to homes, so only the "house" and commercial 
service were going to be available for this project.

Proposals:

1. Reallocate 2 unused motorcycle parking spaces to become parking space "EV1", a paid
   amenity: electric car charging by the hour. The best quote from an electrician would
   use an existing penetration into the area which is directly above the main electric room,
   then place a 240V breaker in the existing garage panel, and install an EVSE, for $3,000.
2. On top of proposal 1, allow owners, at their own cost, to have a branch circuit installed
   in the existing garage panel, first-come, first-served. There may only be available
   electric capacity for 1-2 chargers, at which point a more involved project would be needed.
   No association cost.

No immediate decision was made on the proposals, but there was thoughtful discussion over
the coming months.

While the board had the authority to approve an owner to have an electrician install a one-off
charger and circuit in the building, it would not provide a scalable solution to future
owners or interest. There was a lot of concern about "what if this is the last charger the
building could install."

**Shared charger approved**: Approval to install, using association funds as a new amenity, a
shared EVSE for up to $3,000. The bid included providing a sub-meter to monitor energy use, if needed.

**Private charger approach not approved**: Without a plan to allow more people than just 1-2 install
chargers, it was seen as not building a fair enough framework to be scalable.

The installation went swiftly, though we did not realize that the original bid only covered
the installation of a NEMA 15-40 outlet, not an EVSE as well. We ended up having to approve
an additional expense to purchase a NEMA 15-40 ClipperCreek unit.

The cheap approach (by not buying a networked/integrated billing and metering solution) was
that the electric outlet is locked, and so an owner has to check out the key to plug the EVSE in
to the outlet before use, then return the key after using and disconnecting the EVSE.

## 2014-2015: EV survey, committee proposals

By 2014 our building had 2 EV/PHEV cars in it - a Chevy Volt and a Tesla Model S. 
Both of these vehicles were becoming more popular throughout the Pacific
Northwest, and new owners were becoming interested in the convenience of 
being able to charge at home.

An EV committee was formed and began researching options, looking at what
other buildings had done to implement an approach, and try and form a basis
for an association opinion.

A survey of owners in the building learned that in the next several years
there would be interest in charging.

The owner who headed the committee did an amazingly solid job pulling
together resources, trying to identify incentives that might reduce the HOA's
burden, find a cost-effective, scalable solution for charging in the building, and
soliciting information from other buildings and groups that have undergone 
similar projects.

The committee was not always able to get the best information from 
electrical firms in the area, whether they had experience in EV-related work
or not: many would offer quotes contingent on available load, but were
not very forthcoming about how to obtain load information, or what that
might cost. Many electricians are much too busy to accept small projects.

Two proposals were considered:

1. For $17,000, the installation of an integrated EVSE charging system that
   would be a single-port commercial charging unit with integrated billing
   and metering.
2. For $11,000, installing a new 3-pole breaker in the existing switchgear to
   feed a new 75KVA 480-120/208V 3-phase transformer, panel, core drilling to
   another location in the garage concrete, and installing a single 50-amp 208V
   dedicated outlet or EVSE.

The new transformer and panel would be an effective solution that would provide
additional capacity for future EV charging to be installed at owners' individual
cost to their parking spaces.

In July the recommendation to table the project again was made, recognizing that
there was insufficient demand to justify spending community association funds on
the project. (HOA budgets are run very efficiently and unbudgeted investments such
as these electrical infrastructure changes can be hard to justify, since they
only benefit those interested in the new addition.)

A future solution would need to minimize the association investment or focus
just on the amenity angle.

## 2010-2013: Early interest

In 2010 the association spent a lot of time working out cost savings
and efficiency improvements to offset rising utility rates.

As a part of that process, a homeowner who was very interested in the
development of Tesla and EV, and considering a Tesla Roadster, asked
about the association's roadmap to enable EV charging.

The association entertained some early options with electricians, one
of which identified a plan that would bring in new meter stacks into the
building, transformers and other equipment, for over $47,500. It is
unclear in retrospect what the scope of the plan was.

The decision was made that it was too soon to think about charging and the
question was tabled.

In 2012, after a few continued conversations about charging, the
owner who wanted to invest in EV charging decided to sell their unit
in our building and purchase a unit in another downtown condo
building that had an EV charging offering program. They moved,
had a charger installed, and purchased an early Tesla Model S in 2013.

In 2013, the question of allowing owners to install branch circuits
for trickle chargers for exotic cars came up: with easy access to a
120V outlet, owners of super cars could keep the 12V battery alive
between periods of rest for the car. This was not seen as a compelling
enough reason to invest in building out new infrastructure, but it
was understood that an eventual EV charging program might permit 
trickle chargers.

## “Electricity is not green”

pacnw
The Pacific Northwest has very green electricity thanks to the Columbia River, but in Washington we’re not exactly leading the way: thankfully there is an EV infrastructure sales tax exemption in place (expires the end of 2019), and occasional state EV purchase incentives, but we do not have “right to charge” laws like other states have. I think there is more that could be done to reduce the cost of retrofitting and expanding current service, such as having Seattle City Light build an unbiased EV opinion desk or service. This will continue to be important: in Seattle, as of 2017, the electric code requires that new construction (excluding 1- and 2- family houses) must allocate electrical capacity and even panel space for future electric car charging demand. Since this will have a cost to developers, this means all apartment and condo developments will find ways to monetize and make available EV charging in newer properties.
Cheap power - under $0.10/kWh currently (however, year-over-year utility increases in Seattle, especially over the past 5 years, are skyrocketing, so this will probably no longer be the case by 2023)

# Advice to condo owners and boards

> If you are a small condo building (less than 50 units), it’s possible this content may not to you, or if you do not have a large multi-level concrete garage.  
In this section I wanted to cover my advice to boards and individual owners looking to help adopt EV charging options for their buildings. Every association is different, especially in its declarations and other governing documents, and so your experience may vary. Finding a great electrician to be a partner in this project will go a long way.
Will retain
Will attract
Important to some listings / realtors as a community amenity worth mentioning
> A note to board members: you may… have a duty, etc. … always act in the best interest of the association … will need to gather broad support for members not on the board. You can help to encourage and maintain a fair voice. Make your interest clear and only move forward once community …  
> Condo - hard deed / assigned / owned spaces  

## The luxury of of personal charging

Easiest to compare to having in-unit washer/dryer vs coin-operated somewhere in the building
It is not cheap
It will not make sense to many
Is something that will add value to your unit only if a future owner cares about or already has interest in EVs
All of our owners interested in individual charging clearly wanted a 208/240V Level 2 charger, not a level 1, although a Level 1 or load sharing solution probably would make sense, it’s a “luxury” amenity for people right now
Always wake up with a full charge
Can set scheduled start or stop times, Tesla will even pre-condition the cabin etc. on work days

## Understanding electric distribution infrastructure

The typical infrastructure in the city will be:
- The utility’s distribution network (power lines underground or overhead)
- The utility’s transformers will step-down electricity from their distribution lines to your building, typically inside your building’s electric vault or a nearby vault underground under a sidewalk or street
- Your main electric room will have 1 or more electric service connections running from the electric vault to your main building switchgear or switchboard. In our building, we have a 480V 3-phase 4-wire system in place.
- The switchgear will have service disconnects and other bus equipment in place. Attached to the 480V 3-phase breakers will be either 480V panels or step-down transformers. (Our single-phase common lighting in the garage runs at 277V, while most household and general outlets are running at 120V and require a transformer to be useful).
- Unless you have an existing 120/208V panel that has significant spare capacity (*load* available, not physical space) to install new circuit breakers for branch EV circuits, you will need to install a new step-down transformer for your EV charging system project. Our building chose to install a 75KVA transformer as it was the maximum size transformer that could be installed with an over-the-counter (OTC) permit, making the project less expensive and quicker to execute.
- A new panel will be installed that connects to the transformer. This is where the branch connections to individual EV charging circuit owners will be made. Each branch circuit will have a 208/240V circuit breaker as required by their EVSE. If a sub-meter system is being used, a sub-meter will also need to be installed adjacent to the panel for the branch circuit.
- Owners will work with an electrician, and the building manager, to seek approval to have their electrician install, at their own cost, the branch circuit conduit - including any penetrations through concrete, drilling costs, concrete x-rays, mounting the conduit, etc., to their parking spot.
- The electrician would then install the EVSE in the parking space.
From the utility your building will have one or more electric service connections. The utility’s electric vault is where the utility brings in power from the grid.

## Decisions to make

- Do our governing documents (declaration, etc.) allow the community to offer new amenities or approve new uses for Common and Limited Common spaces?
- What is the process for creating a new policy or approving changes to Limited Common parking spaces?
- Whose electric service will be used for the system?
- Do we have sufficient available electric load for the project? Is there data available from the utility? Do we need a load study or plan review? What permit requirements will be made? The outcome of this data will be a few different choices including:
	- If you have a current panel that has spare load and also spare physical capacity for new breakers
	- If you have capacity for the load, but not physical space, and so need a new sub-panel
	- If you have load available from one of your building services, but would need to install a new main breaker, transformer, and panel
	- If your building does not have sufficient electrical service to support your desired new electric charging loads - and would require the utility to bring in new service to your building
- What requirements do we have for contractors?
- How will the association be repaid if its house energy is used?
- Is there enough interest for a community charger?
- Is there significant interest for the community as a whole to invest in infrastructure?
- Is there interest to approve new infrastructure (“hub”) that owners reserve into and allow owners to install at their cost (“spoke”)?
- Do we design a small incremental program, or go big?
- Do we use a charging-as-a-service provider, or install a project that will have monthly port charges?
- Does the program offer Level 1 (120V) and/or Level 2 (208/240V) charging?
- Should installations use a wall connector EVSE system, outlets, or allow either?
- Do we allow owners to use load sharing to install charging in multiple parking spaces of theirs, or make charging available to their parking neighbors?
- Are there specific models or charging systems that need approval?
- Do we need to suggest a location for chargers to be mounted against walls, or pillars, or posts? Do our owners understand the authority having jurisdiction may require the use of bollards or posts or other protective devices?
- How much community money are we willing to invest, if any, in charging that benefits individuals?
- Would we approve using community money in the short term if over the remainder of the specific EV project the community money is completely repaid?
- Do we allow reservation holders to reassign or sell their investment to other owners?
- Do we require reservation holders to install a complete project, or can they wait until the future, or partially install the electric conduit system now?
- What happens when there is demand for additional chargers after the project?
- Do we want to setup a fund for helping with future plans, design or engineering work as the charging problem gets more challenging?
- Do we have wireless Internet in the garage, or do we want to make it available?

## Program outline

Use annual member meetings and surveys to measure broad interest
Setup a committee to investigate implementation details, learn about the local authority’s requirements for installations, load testing, etc.
Host an “EV Open House” or community event for interested owners
Consider installing a community EV charging amenity if your building has available shared/community spaces
Work with the rules and architecture committees to develop a policy framework
Approve a policy contingent on receiving enough financial commitment to fund an infrastructure investment within a set period of time, first-come, first-served
Implement the project and gather feedback
Prepare a summary of advice or notes for the next iteration of the program

## Tips - shared amenity charging

Xyzzy
Do not make it complicated
Have sane rules to allow an overnight charge
Encourage your EV owners to get to know each other and communicate
Consider either using a managed charging system (ChargePoint) or make community charging free
Do not do what we did

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2019ev/chargingbay.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="" />

## Consider specific circuit breaker sizes

x
People who do not know better will always want “more”, even when they do not need it
Always be charging
Fear and uncertainty
The National Electric Code designates charging stations as a “dedicated continuous load”, which means that 125% of the load needs to be available at the circuit breaker. **This surprises many people, even electricians**. This means that you cannot pack your panel as full as you would like: if you want to install a 32-amp EVSE on a branch circuit, you’ll need to have it wired to a 40-amp circuit breaker; a 40-amp charger will need a 50-amp breaker, etc.
It’s a little unfortunate, since it means you have to over invest in infrastructure to support EV charging. This is also why it’s important to think through how much load you need to provision and the specific size circuit breakers you will be allowing in your installation.

## Approaches to recovering energy costs

City meters
Sub-meter panel
Sub-meter circuits
Fixed monthly cost
Managed charging platforms (i.e. ChargePoint)
Free charging
NOTE that your utility’s specifics may impact this… may have time and demand-based charging rates
NOTE some jurisdictions may not allow you to sub-meter electricity
As of this writing, in Seattle we do not have time-of-day rates
Our “house” circuit does have demand charges based on peak demand

## Tips - individual charging

Do not authorize one-off installations using existing panels
Do consider load sharing and managed service providers if there is significant initial demand
If setting up a community shared charger, price it to encourage use
Think about an efficient and fair chargeback scheme
Consider using a first-come, first-served reservation scheme
Consider specific circuit size limits
Make sure owners are approved by the board and/or building manager and use a licensed, bonded, insured electrician
Make sure owners’ electricians obtain a permit from city and that the work is signed off on by the authority having jurisdiction

## Thinking about load sharing and fleet charging providers

This space will continue to evolve
There are companies offering “charging-as-a-service” products, where they cover the capital infrastructure investment in return for the long-term right to collect monthly service and maintenance income from your building and owners.
Many EVSEs can load share among multiple units
Tesla Wall Connector, for example, can be configured to share power between 4 charging units that are each up to 50 feet apart
In the next decade it’s easy to imagine these large load sharing and power management platforms will be the de-facto approach to handling large fleets of vehicles or large residential garage projects.

## Approaches we did not pursue

- Allowing owners to branch their residential unit’s power and install conduit from that to their parking spaces
- New utility meters dedicated to individual EV chargers

# Advice to Washington State policy makers and utilities

> **The State of Washington does not have “right to charge laws”** like some states do (California, Colorado, Florida and Oregon). In California, [Civil Code 4745, 4745.1]([Law section](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4745.&lawCode=CIV)) states that “HOAs may not prohibit or unreasonably restrict the installation or use of electric vehicle charging stations in a designated parking space.” As a result, in Washington there is a strong bias for inaction in Washington condo associations with regard to pilot programs and working to extend EV charging, since no charge is easiest to manage, and in general, and HOA board can simply deny any request. **Washington needs a right-to-charge law** to help accelerate EV adoption by encouraging HOAs to think through how to implement and build a smart program for letting their owners, at their own individual cost, install electric charging equipment in a fair manner, or invest in shared infrastructure.  


Consider right-to-charge laws
Continue with the utility EV adoption programs that Puget Sound Energy has been piloting
Consider extending the expiring 2019 sales tax exemption
Compared to states like California, unfortunately Washington sends a lot of mixed signals
Jeff’s pipe dream: SCL EV green lighting approach: waive, offer load studies, plan review optimizations
SCL to help perform or provide discounts for panel and other load studies
SCL to provide professional experienced advice at no cost

# Electric code sections of note

Pointers-
SCL NEC inserts
SCL EV guides
National Electric Code

# Looking forward

Newer condos are evolving due to code changes they will monetize the required parking spaces they must bring conduit to
Newer buildings in Seattle must have sufficient energy for many spaces to have at least a 20-amp 208/240V Level 2 charger



# Misc
I am not an electrician. I can not be responsible for your community’s approach, even if you chose to take advice from this posting. Consider using professional advice, whether that includes legal advice on new rules and regulations or policies, electrician advice on load studies and planning for panel capacity, etc.
Kudos to everyone who owns a single-family home, it’s often so insanely cheap and easy - $500-$1,000 - to get a licensed electrician and permit to help install EV charging on your existing home service load. Running this project made me think regularly about selling my condo and just buying a home instead.
My biases and notes regarding this project and this post:
- I believe that Level 2 charging (208/240V 20-amp or more current) is a requirement for someone to want to invest thousands of dollars in such a condo project
- I believe private, individual charging is a luxury
- Our condo building, constructed in 2002, has declaration-assigned parking spaces, making the movement of parking spaces very expensive and time consuming, so this favors in-place installations at cost
- Load sharing is great, but our association’s requirement to sub-meter utilities makes it ineffective, at least for our first installation project. (Note, some owners who would like multiple chargers will find load sharing great)
- Charging-as-a-service providers have too many unknowns, especially in how such firms will remain profitable over time, to commit an association to such a contract
I do want to hear if others find this content helpful. Let me know on Twitter!

The TL;DR version

My $6,000 Tesla Wall Connector: the story of bringing Electric Vehicle charging to my high-rise condo tower in Seattle... essentially a 5-year project.

Timeline

Early interest ; attract, retain

The question about charging started again in 2016 especially after the Model 3 reservations started.

Shared community EV amenity

Our existing garage panel could probably support 1-2 EV branch circuits, but would require a load study, 
and not enough interest. Since it wouldn't benefit everyone, it must land in a way that only owners individually
pay, not the community.

A few years back our "house" service from the utility got a peak demand meter
The utility was able to pull this data to help us secure an over-the-counter permit for new infrastructure
75KVA transformer, 200-amp 120/208V panel
Transformers are amazing

Rules were approved after community feedback pending enough reservations for the project to be in the green.
Happened over a 2-month period.

It's expensive since we have a post-tension concrete 4-level garage, so penetrations that require a core drill 
would need to have imaging done to make sure there's no risk of hitting the PT cables.

Also, parking spaces can be very far away from the main electric room panel, requiring hundreds of feet of
conduit and thick-gauge wire

Along the way, a lot of fear and uncertainty: "I need a huge breaker size", "the car dealer says it will take
days to charge and not to do this", "you always charge from empty to full", ...

In the end it's a great luxury being able to charge an EV at home. When you get home from work, just step out,
hit the button on the Tesla charger, and wake up the next morning with a full charge.

We benefitted from a tax exemption in Washington State on EV infrastructure (no sales tax through end of 2019
on the entire set of infrastructure if used for EV)

Final cost for the community's EV1 project supporting 8 owners' EV charging: $XXX

Final cost for a sample individual: 

As a result there's a lot more interest in EVs, and many people have purchased them recently, 
especially thanks to having access to the shared amenity. We went from 1 Tesla before the project to 6 now 
and growing.
