Access points placed where they're useful. WiFi that just works. True symmetric 
gigabit Internet connectivity. Modern managed UniFi network gear built by 
Ubiquiti Networks. Wiring CAT6 and dealing with not-so-modern CAT3 in an apartment.

This is my long-overdue post about some of the delightful experiences, challenges, 
and summary of the tech I'm thankful to have access to at home that pleases my 
inner geek.

This post will be much too long, full of unoptimized images, regrettfully a rough 
experience for anyone without fast Internet. Some humblebrag in here, too. Blogging may
be nearly dead, but there's no way I could tweet all of this.

# Overview

Seattle isn't the most competitive communications city in America, but it feels to 
be in a pretty good spot near the top of that list. It's especially great for 
urban dwellers, where specialized providers have been able to cherry-pick tech 
customers by quickly bringing fast connectivity into multi-family buildings.

## Wave G Gigabit (CondoInternet)

CondoInternet, founded a decade ago (2008) in Seattle, has been the gold standard for 
tech employees looking for very fast, great service at home. While the company 
has been acquired a few times, today the service is known as Wave G and it's still 
as fast as ever, offering 100Mbps at home for $60/month and 1000Mbps for $80/month.

Wave G doesn't have bandwidth caps or play games like the cable companies who are 
using words like "gig" a little too judiciously. You connect your router directly to 
the ISP's managed network switch, where the port is configured to the speed you 
pay for.

The service uses a backbone with fiber and rooftop microwave backhaul gear, 
peers with the class Seattle fiber hotel at the Westin Building Exchange, and is 
truly awesome.

## Ubiquiti Networks - UniFi

With a very fast Internet connection comes the responsibility of managing your 
home network with a mind toward simplicity, performance, and awesomeness.

While many customers of CondoInternet enjoy the typical consumer gear - Asus, 
Linksys, Apple - it makes sense to invest in business-grade equipment that 
will last longer, offer advanced features, and be able to move as many packets 
as possible.

I invested in a set of Ubiquiti Networks gear in 2016 after having an Asus router 
that bit the dust. While I started with their EdgeRouter line of carrier gear, I 
eventually switched to the UniFi line that has an exceptional web interface, mobile 
apps, and a nice community / fan base.

Today this means a dedicated controller device, multiple access points, a power-over-ethernet (PoE) switch, and their security gateway router product.

With 2 years of experience with UniFi, I must say, I am a very happy customer, as 
evidenced by the build-outs I've done in my unit, in my building at large, 
convinced friends to do, and yes, my Twitter feed. I love their stuff! 

## Condo wiring challenges

The building I live in was built in 2003, a time when CAT5 is a very common 
cabling choice. Several other buildings built in the same condo era have CAT5 
from each floor's telecommunications closet to the unit.

For whatever reason, my building's developer was cheap, and so our building 
was cursed with **Category 3 (CAT3)** network cable.

What is CAT3? It's not CAT5, that's for sure. [According to wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_3_cable), it "was widely 
used in computer networking in the early 1990s for 10BASE-T Ethernet".

In my building, they've used 6-pair CAT3 cable, so that they can run 
a 10/100 network alongside traditional teleco service on the same cable, 
saving money.

Here's the fun part: through some in-unit modifications and luck, I'm able to 
get full 1000Mbps connectivity through the CAT3 cable. While I'd love to 
pull new CAT6 from the comms room, the flex conduit run inside the concrete 
slab is only a quarter inch, and there are snags in the run, so it would be 
a super fragile operation.

## Disclaimers

This post is from the perspective of a tech enthusiast in Seattle: I do not represent any of the companies mentioned, and the information I have about the Seattle region's Internet providers and services is only as accurate as what I have researched and the stories I've heard.

While all of my initial Ubiquiti equipment purchases were my own, in late 2017 I was 
provided a single UniFi AC-HD access point unit by Ubiquiti to try out. I have since 
purchased an AC-HD access point at my own cost.

# Seattle Internet Connectivity

Even today, I remember the conversation with my friend Alex a decade ago when 15Mbps 
down and 1Mbps up was a pretty common cable Internet product offering:

> Alex: "Yeah, well, we have CondoInternet. It's symmetric 100 Mbps up and down."
>
> Me: "Hmm... that seems pretty hard to believe. That's like what I had at university... There must be caps or something. It can't be  that fast!"
>
> Alex: "Well, it's real. Also, they offer 1000Mbps up and down, a static IP if you want it, no bandwidth caps, no contract."

Turns out it's real. Comcast is even starting to bow to the pressure of "gigabit" (since all the millenial tech employees just use
Wave G); t hey're starting to advertise "gig speeds", with lower upload capability and bandwidth caps. Will be interesting to watch
what develops with DOCSIS 3.1.

I love being a millisecond away from the Westin Building Exchange (Seattle Internet Exchange and all of that lovely peering), 
with a 1000Mbps connection, and never a problem.

## 60GHz Microwave Internet

60 GHz unlicensed spectrum; BridgeWave hardware; SFP; 45 watts consumption https://www.bridgewavedirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BW64_64X_Datasheet.pdf

Today we're also seeing a lot of Ubiquiti equipment appearing on rooftops, but our building is still served by the BridgeWave product line.

## Competition

Three years ago, the [Seattle City Council ended the "cable franchise" system](https://www.geekwire.com/2015/seattle-city-council-approves-legislation-that-eliminates-cable-tv-franchise-districts/) in the city, enabling multiple 
cable providers to finally compete for service. This is most evident in our condo now: for over a decade our 
building was served by what is today known as "Wave Broadband", but has had other names such as Millennium Digital in the 
past. In late 2017, Comcast brought conduit into our building's main distribution frame and then to each floor's independent 
distribution frame, so today every unit in our building has complete choice between 5 providers, including 2 cable providers for TV, Internet, etc..

While the franchise rules were removed a few years ago, only recently did our building's 10-year contract expire (with an exclusivity clause) expire, allowing us to open the cable portion of the building up to multiple providers.

Our condominium has several connectivity choices, a more common thing now that the quasi-monopoly of a single cable provider per building has been struck down. Every individual unit in our building has their own choice between the following providers:

- CenturyLink traditional phone and DSL
- Wave broadband cable TV, Internet, phone
- Comcast cable TV, Internet, phone
- Wave G Gigabit Internet
- DirecTV satellite TV service

I believe that most people in our building use Wave G for Internet, but I do not have data. Not having a modem between the provider is clean and simple.

## Seattle: Westin Building Exchange

I still remember the disbelief when a good friend told me they had "true 100mbps Internet at home, but could upgrade to gigabit" in 2009. Their Internet service was powered by CondoInternet. Turns out I also lived in a building served by CondoInternet and so was active with the service a few hours later after a quick phone call to activate my account, where they flipped on my unit's Ethernet drop from their network closet. That was easy. Working at Microsoft I appreciate the world-class network I have access to at work, but I love that when I work from home, I have Internet that is as fast, or faster, than what I have at work, with lower latencies and a very direct connection to the Westin Building Exchange.

Techies in Seattle living in apartments and condo buildings have had blazing fast Internet for almost a decade. I am blessed to have gigabit Internet connectivity at home for the monthly cost of $80. While gigabit speeds are very common today across the region and especially worldwide, across the United States the cable monopoly and lobbyists tend to prevent any competition in this space. Wave G provides a high-value service in dense areas, essentially cashing in on customers with high expectations for connectivity and being able to cherry pick great opportunities for installations.

Today Wave G is the same service - CondoInternet (and its parent, Spectrum Networks) was acquired. Wave has also recently snatched up other niche providers in the area. CondoInternet was a boutique Seattle-area ISP serving multi-family dwellings, providing awesome connectivity, no bandwidth caps, taking advantage of the ease of wiring modern construction for Ethernet, all while monopolies like Comcast offered compartively slow, expensive services.

Since CondoInternet became available, I have lived in 3 buildings served by CondoInternet, most recently purchasing a condo a few years ago in a building with the service. I find it interesting that buildings and realtors do not more prominently advertise the availability of gigabit Internet service in the same way that Seattle Craigslist ads regularly mention "one block away from the Microsoft Connector", etc., to help draw in the tech crowd.

# My UniFi network

- Ubiquiti UniFi
  - The pitch
  - The hardware
  - My EdgeMax experience
  - Fan replacement
  - My network

Separation of concerns is central to any software developer's mindset, and when it comes
to the ever-important home network, until recently "enterprise-grade" networking has been
rather expensive and frankly not always worth it.


Today I enjoy gigabit Internet and a Ubiquiti UniFi network at home; while there are
many upstarts today in wireless home mesh networks and other products today, as an
engineer I love separation of concerns, and having a gateway whose job is routing separate
from access points to do the WiFi just makes great sense.

While there are many other Ubiquiti success stories on the Internet, this one is mine. I
strongly recommend [Troy Hunt's post](https://www.troyhunt.com/ubiquiti-all-the-things-how-i-finally-fixed-my-dodgy-wifi/);
also, a special shoutout to [Clint Rutkas](https://twitter.com/ClintRutkas) for sharing his
experience - he embarked on a similar journey around the same time, and I know many of my
coworkers at Microsoft also have great Ubiquiti experiences.

>> UniFi screen capture

This is also a great opportunity for me to rain praise upon Wave G, Seattle's finest
gigabit Internet provider, and a super interesting success story of its own: while Wave G
is high tech, my building is not so much, so the last 100 feet to my apartment is
[CAT3 cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_3_cable), something I'd never
heard of, and I hope you do not need to deal with.

>>> WAVE G / MICROWAVE

I absolutely love the advanced features that Ubiquiti offers at in easy-to-use manner. From
VLAN tagging and separate SSIDs for guest networks, to advanced connectivity options; I have
a site-to-site VPN running between a one of my Azure (Microsoft Cloud) virtual networks in a Microsoft datacenter
and my home. Technically Ubiquiti hardware is based on the open source Vyatta OS.

Accessible from anywhere online, the UniFi controller software provides a simple, clean interface that lets you manage the family of network devices from a central place.

When you connect a new UniFi device to your local network, you 'adopt' the device through the controller, at which point you can configure and control it. You can also see devices that are disabled or not currently connected, but that have been adopted.

Events such as interference on wireless channels, administrators signing into the controller, PoE devices coming online, and new clients are all shown in this area. I also pipe all of these events to my network attached storage.

One issue I had, with my home office use of the UniFi equipment, is that I do not have a nicely cooled server room to store the equipment in. Instead, the equipment is in the media cabinet connected to my home office.

The fans in both the UniFi 24-port PoE switch and also the security gateway were too noisy for my taste, so I replaced them with Noctua brand quiet fans. It's much nicer now, though my warranty is probably voided. The cost for a quiet home environment.

do say it's a nice and easy product, and it has some nice features.

# Condo challenges

## WiFi in the city

## CAT3

## As-built records

## Metal studs

An interesting side effect of living in a high-rise building is that our tower is constructed 
with common commercial construction materials, so in our building we have steel studs supporting 
the walls as opposed to wood.

This makes pulling wires more difficult, you need to use wire grommits to protect the wires, and 
if you cannot find an existing penetration in the studs, you need to improvise. A positive of the 
metal studs, however, is that there is a not a wood fire block halfway up the wall as you might 
find if you're wiring CAT6 across multiple levels in a traditional American home.

## Interior vs exterior walls

Our condo association rules are more strict about "limited common" walls (those shared with the community 
or other owners), so it's easy to run wires and things within your own interior walls, but if you are 
dealing with the exterior walls you need to instead run cables through exposed conduit, behind the baseboards, 
under the floors, etc.

Fun stuff.

In my office, which shares a common wall with another unit, I have several cables running under the floor 
now, including speaker wire, several CAT6 pulls, and 2x digital optical audio cables.
