The <a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/">Silverlight Toolkit</a> contains implicit style management features that let you create a nice theme – buttons, checkboxes, you name it – and have it automatically applied to an application. Nearly half a year ago, I worked with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mehdis/">Mehdi</a> to create a rather simple, but functional, tool prototype for working with Xaml theme files and ISM-consumable implicit style definitions. 

Great stuff for designers, this prototype tool enables designers to use Blend day-to-day for getting immediate feedback and excellent tooling support, while being able to round-trip themes, from Blend to ISM to Blend again.

This tool is not guaranteed to be lossless. Use it at your own risk. It will take a XAML file that Blend appreciates (details on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mehdis/archive/2008/11/18/creating-new-ism-compatible-themes.aspx">Mehdi's blog</a>):

<ul>
	<li>No x:Key attributes</li>
	<li>References to other styles by key name become fully qualified resource lookups: from ScrollViewerStyle to System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer</li>
	<li>There are some assumption about naming</li>
	<li>Adding explicit references to other styles</li>
</ul>

... and convert it into an ISM theme.

Today I’m finally blogging a prototype version of the app, a work-in-progress, hoping that maybe others will have the time to make better use of it than I have. I have grand visions for the tool: add a file system watcher, monitor file saves in Blend, and then immediately msbuilding updated ISM theme assembly files. Updating sample apps behind the scenes. Real-time theme previews. None of those grand features are in the download. Give it time.

To run, use either:
ToolkitTheme.exe App.xaml /t:ism MyIsmTheme.xaml
ToolkitTheme.exe MyIsmTheme.xaml /t:blend App.xaml

Since this is a proof-of-concept prototype, I'm only releasing source for now, assuming you're a developer at heart - no designer binaries. Let me know if you have any feedback on the tool!
