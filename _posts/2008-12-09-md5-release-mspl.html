<p>I was pleased to see that earlier today Reid Borsuk (of Microsoft's CLR security team) released his MD5 implementation (pure transparent Silverlight code) to the MSDN Code Gallery earlier today. This will open the door for developers looking to interact with services and data systems that still use MD5. This release is licensed with the open source <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SilverlightMD5/Project/License.aspx">Ms-PL license</a>.</p>  <p><em>Check it out on the </em><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SilverlightMD5"><em>MSDN Code site</em></a><em>:</em>    <br /><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SilverlightMD5/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1823"><strong>Download the source code</strong></a></p>  <p>I use <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr's web services</a> and for most of the more advanced operations, you need to 'sign' the request using an MD5 shared secret - so this is a great improvement on what I had <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/03/05/silverlight-2-md5/">previously blogged about</a> at MIX. I've been using this code for a few weeks now and love it.</p>  <p>I won't get into a discussion on the pros or cons of MD5, other than to say, this is freaking awesome! Congratulations Reid.</p>
