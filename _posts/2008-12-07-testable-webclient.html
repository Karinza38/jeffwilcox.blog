<p>Testability is important to today's developers, and without a mocking framework available for Silverlight developers today, it is possible, albeit with a little extra work, to create testable components.</p>  <p><a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/theproblemsolver/">Maurice de Beijer</a> has blogged about his solution for <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/theproblemsolver/archive/2008/12/07/unit-testing-in-silverlight-part-2.aspx">creating a testable Flickr web service API</a>. He's created TestableWebClient and TestableOpenReadCompletedEventArgs types to assist with this, and kept the abstraction simple and to-the-point.</p>  <p>I agree with Maurice's comments: it isn't perfect, it isn't awful; it isn't pretty; but hey, it does get the job done, and he's found a good solution for this today.</p>  <p><a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/theproblemsolver/archive/2008/12/07/unit-testing-in-silverlight-part-2.aspx"><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/image_0C17D5DB.png" /></a> </p>  <p>Maurice also previously posted his own <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/theproblemsolver/archive/2008/12/02/unit-testing-in-silverlight-part-1.aspx">introduction guide to Silverlight unit testing</a>.</p>  <p>Just wanted to pass along, definitely check this out!</p>
