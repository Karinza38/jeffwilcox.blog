Access points placed where they're useful. WiFi that just works. True symmetric
gigabit Internet connectivity. Modern managed UniFi network gear built by
[Ubiquiti Networks](https://www.ubnt.com/). Pulling CAT6 cable while dealing
with ancient CAT3 in a condo.

This is my long-overdue post about some of the delightful experiences, challenges,
and summary of the tech I'm thankful to have access to at home that pleases my
inner geek.

This post will be much too long, full of unoptimized images, regrettfully a rough
experience for anyone without fast Internet. Some humblebrag in here, too. Blogging may
be nearly dead, but there's no way I could tweet all of this.

# Overview

Seattle a pretty good place to be a techie, and for urban dwellers, gigabit
Internet is the norm, thanks to a number of specialized providers have been able
to cherry-pick tech customers by quickly bringing fast connectivity into
multi-family buildings. Thankfully this creates pressure for the more
traditional providers to compete on price, speed and features.

## Wave G Gigabit (CondoInternet)

CondoInternet, founded a decade ago (2008) in Seattle, has been the gold standard for
tech employees looking for very fast, great service at home. While the company
has been acquired a few times, today the service is known as
[Wave G](https://waveg.wavebroadband.com/), and it's still
as fast as ever, offering 100Mbps at home for $60/month and 1000Mbps for $80/month.

Wave G doesn't have bandwidth caps or play games like the cable companies who are
using words like "gig" a little too judiciously. You connect your router directly to
the ISP's managed network switch a few feet away, where the port is configured to the speed you
pay for.

Wave G then has its own network with fiber and rooftop microwave backhaul gear,
peering inside the [Westin Building Exchange](https://www.westinbldg.com/) and
[Seattle Internet Exchange (SIX)](https://www.seattleix.net/),
providing ultra low latency and short hops around the Internet.

## Ubiquiti Networks - UniFi

With a very fast Internet connection comes the responsibility of managing your
home network with a mind toward simplicity, performance, and awesomeness.

While many customers of CondoInternet enjoy the typical consumer gear - Asus,
Linksys, Apple - it makes sense to invest in business-grade equipment that
will last longer, offer advanced features, and be able to move as many packets
as possible.

I invested in a set of Ubiquiti Networks gear in 2016 after having an Asus router
that bit the dust. While I started with their EdgeRouter line of carrier gear, I
eventually switched to their [UniFi line of "Enterprise WiFi Systems"](https://unifi-sdn.ubnt.com/) and
software-defined networking equipment, complete with an exceptional web interface, mobile
apps, and a nice community / fan base.

Today this means a dedicated controller device, multiple access points, a
power-over-ethernet (PoE) switch, and their security gateway router product.

With 2 years of experience with UniFi, I must say, I am a very happy customer, as
evidenced by the build-outs I've done in my unit, in my building at large,
convinced friends to do, and yes, my Twitter feed. I love their stuff!

## Condo wiring challenges

The building I live in was built in 2003, a time when CAT5 is a very common
cabling choice. Several other buildings built in the same condo era have CAT5
from each floor's telecommunications closet to the unit.

For whatever reason, my building's developer was cheap, and so our building
was cursed with **Category 3 (CAT3)** network cable.

What is CAT3? It's not CAT5, that's for sure. [According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_3_cable), it "was widely
used in computer networking in the early 1990s for 10BASE-T Ethernet".

In my building, they've used 6-pair CAT3 cable, so that they can run
a 10/100 network alongside traditional teleco service on the same cable,
saving money.

Here's the fun part: through some in-unit modifications and luck, I'm able to
get full 1000Mbps connectivity through the CAT3 cable. While I'd love to
pull new CAT6 from the comms room, the flex conduit run inside the concrete
slab is only a quarter inch, and there are snags in the run, so it would be
a super fragile operation.

## Disclaimers

This post is from the perspective of a tech enthusiast in Seattle: I do not
represent any of the companies mentioned, and the information I have about the
Seattle region's Internet providers and services is only as accurate as what I
have researched and the stories I've heard.

While all of my initial Ubiquiti equipment purchases were my own, in late 2017 I was
provided a single UniFi AC-HD access point unit by Ubiquiti to try out. I have since
purchased an AC-HD access point at my own cost.

<p style="font-size: 36px" text="Too long; don't read">tl; dr</p>

# Wave G

Even today, I remember the conversation with my friend Alex a decade ago when 15/2
(15Mbps down, 2Mbps up) was a pretty common cable Internet product offering, and
if you had to get DSL, it would be even slower.

> Alex: "Yeah, well, in my building we have CondoInternet now. It's symmetric 100 Mbps up and down."
>
> Me: "Hmm... that seems pretty hard to believe. That's like what I had at university... There must be caps or something. It can't be  that fast!"
>
> Alex: "Well, it's real. Also, they offer 1000Mbps up and down, a static IP if you want it, no bandwidth caps, no contract. The future!"

Turns out: it's real.

The provider I use is called Wave G, formerly CondoInternet, formerly a part of
Spectrum Networks, then acquired by Wave Broadband, and now it's owned by a
leveraged-buyout/investment firm, TPG Capital, so that will be interesting to
see where it goes.

Another area provider, CascadeLink, was purchased by Wave; and there are still
a few other options - Webpass (now owned by Google Fiber) is in our
neighborhood.

From my home network, my CAT6 networked machines get sub-millisecond to 1ms
ping times to Google, Microsoft, and all the major modern Internet services, with
just a few hops.

This is because Wave G is just a hope away from Seattle's best peering opportunity: our
building has gigabits of bandwidth to the [Westin Building Exchange](https://www.westinbldg.com/),
within which is the non-profit [Seattle Internet Exchange](https://www.seattleix.net/about).

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/waveg-ping-times.png" class="img-responsive" title="" />

## Rooftop millimeter wave radio backhaul

Our condo building's Wave G connectivity is based on microwave, but the Wave G
network does also include fiber links. If you look out from our tower's roof toward Elliott Bay, you can see a few of
the other nearby buildings that we connect to:

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/other-buildings.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="A look toward Elliott Bay, highlighting microwave Internet rooftop connections as part of the neighborhood mesh network." />

Turning around and facing downtown Seattle, looking across the Belltown
neighborhood, there are many rooftop sites:

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/other-buildings2.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="Looking across the Belltown neighborhood, nearly every rooftop has microwave backhaul equipment." />

Our roof has at least 6x [BridgeWave 60GHz millimeter wave radios](https://bridgewave.com/bw64/).
Each of these antennas provides a 1Gbps full-duplex encrypted link between locations.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/rooftop-microwaves.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="Rooftop 60GHz microwave backhaul equipment." />

## Low-latency + fast

I usually get speeds in excess of 900Mbps when I test with [SpeedTest](http://www.speedtest.net/) or
other services, though sometimes I'll see speeds closer to 700Mbps. Only
wired equipment will experience the full potential, as WiFi clients in my
urban neighborhood deal with a lot of interference from thousands of competing
wireless devices.

According to Netflix's [fast.com](https://fast.com) just now, my connection
speed is approximately 920 Mbps. I like that the Netflix service does a good
job of estimating your Netflix experience, which is a super common activity
for home users.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/netflix-fast.png"
class="img-responsive"
style="max-width: 400px"
title="According to Netflix fast.com, the connection speed is approximately 920 Mbps." />

## Static IPs and IPv6 blocks

I don't actually know the latest on this story (whether it's a monthly or a
one-time charge now), but when I requested my static IP years ago, it was a one-time
fee for a static static IPv4 address, and now I also have my own IPv6 block.

## Great tech support

I've never experienced a large outage, but when I was first setting up my
connection, due to the CAT3 wiring to my unit, I was only able to get 100Mbps
connection to the carrier switch.

A tech was able to come out and help me diagnose the connectivity issue -
because of the token ring CAT3 wiring in my unit, the signal was being
heavily degraded.

We experimented with a few alternate locations and ideas, and in the end, found
that by terminating the CAT3 pairs for the network connection as soon as
reasonable (near where the CAT3 homerun came out of the concrete slab's conduit),
I could get a reliable 1000Mbps connection.

## Easy activation

Since there are no contracts, and multi-family buildings are all wired for
their service up to your local communications room, it's easy to get going.

If your unit has been served by Wave G in the past, chances are you have an
Ethernet jack in your unit that is still connected to their switch in a
nearby comms room.

I've lived in 3 different buildings with Wave G service in the past, and in all
cases was able to get up and running over the phone or quickly after signing up
for the service, as they can activate the port for the speed you need, and
you're on your way.

If your unit hasn't been served by them in the past, there are a few different
scenarios, but they all play out quickly by a tech:

- Your unit's cable may need to be punched down or patched to a Wave G switch port
- Your unit's interior network closet may need to get patched to the Wave G uplink
- You may need to have an existing telephone jack converted to a CAT6 keystone jack (if you're served by CAT3, which was my case)
- You might need a VDSL or other device (probably rare now)

## A valuable asset to apartments/condos

I made it a point while looking to purchase a home that I understood the current
Internet offerings available for each potential property.

I'm surprised that more apartment rental advertisements or real estate listings
do not clearly call out that they are served by a modern gigabit Internet
provider. While it feels like nearly every modern apartment building in the city
has such a provider available now, I still meet fellow tech employees and
building residents who aren't aware of how great the offering is.

Seems worth highlighting, similar to letting people know that your property
is within walking distance of a Microsoft Connector bus stop for employees.

## Building infrastructure

I am only familiar with the infrastructure in my current building, but I imagine
all are relatively similar.

The Main Distribution Frame (MDF) is located 3 levels below ground, on our "C"
level of the parking garage. This is where the phone company, multiple cable
companies, and other services come together, and for Wave G, it is where there is
switching equipment, fiber splicing, UPS backup, etc.

Here is our building's MDF. From left to right, there's:
- the traditional telephone provider
- various business phone lines
- fire equipment
- VOIP lines and our building's private network
- Comcast coax
- Wave G rack of equipment
- Wave Broadband coax
- DirecTV

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/2018-mdf-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="A look at the main distribution frame (comms room) serving the building, including traditional telco, multiple cable providers, DirecTV, and our rooftop microwave backhaul provider." />

From the MDF, fiber runs up 15 floors to the rooftop of the building through
risers, and on the roof, microwave gear is mounted in multiple clusters.

Every few floors up the risers we have telecomm rooms. These rooms are also known
as Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) rooms, and tend to have switching
gear connected to the building's emergency generator power circuit.

The switch gear is located adjacent to coax cable gear, traditional telephone
gear, etc.

The IDFs are typically a mess. Here's the IDF on my floor... from left to right,
there's a panel where the fiber and some network cabling goes up to the rooftop
microwaves, then Comcast, then some of our building's network, Wave G equipment
and switch, traditional telco, individual unit CAT3 patch panels, coax and
other equipment, and a bunch of messy coax splitters and amplifiers.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/idf-11.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="A sample IDF, full of equipment, switch, lots of different communications providers in one place." />

Our individual unit's homerun cabling comes into punchdown terminals and then
can be patched into the Wave G switch as needed.

Here's a closer look at the short patch runs from the switch down to hte
CAT3 unit patch panels:

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/idf-patch.jpg"
style="max-width: 300px"
class="img-responsive" title="" />

And then the CAT3 runs go through small flex conduit embedded in the concrete
ceiling slabs. A single CAT3 cable in our building can then support both
plain-old-telephone-service (POTS) and modern Wave G (Ethernet). Sort of:

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/idf-conduit-homeruns.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="Conduit homeruns embedded in the slab" />

Our building is actually composed of 2 towers. Large conduit in the C level of
the garage (3 floors underground) connects the 2 towers. Wave G has run fiber
between the towers, and other communications providers have their coax/etc.
running in similar conduit.

# Seattle's Internet connectivity

## Seattle's peering community

Seattle, and the Pacific Northwest's Internet gravity, is located the corner of
6th Avenue and Virginia Street at the edge of Belltown and downtown Seattle.
Known as the Westin Building, its original anchor tenant was the corporate office
for the Westin hotel chain, until the chain was purchased by Starwood Hotels.
Once Westin relocated its HQ, all the vacant space became prime network real
estate.

I honestly don't know the exact network topology between my condo building
and the Westin Building Exchange (WBX), whether it's microwave to WBX or if it is
microwave to the NYI SEA1 data center on Western Ave, a few blocks away from
my condo, and then fiber from there to WBX.

## Westin Building Exchange

The Seattle intersection of 6th Ave and Virginia Street is a busy spot: there's
gridlock on the streets, thousands of Amazon employees finding lunch each day,
the Westin hotel next door, but the best thing of all is the
Westin Building Exchange: terabytes of bandwidth; the epicenter of Seattle's Internet.

While the Westin Building was once a traditional office building, today the 34-story
building is mostly full of carriers, network gear, and tons of fiber. I can only
imagine how much bandwidth the building has.

The building is home to over 200 ISPs, carriers and service providers; according
[to the Westin Building Exchange datasheet](https://www.westinbldg.com/Content/PDF/WBX_Fact_Sheet.pdf),
they have over 19.5 megawatts of backup generation available from 17 diesel
generators.

If you've heard of Equinix, a major connectivity company, their SE2 data
center is located within the Westin Building, and a few years ago they built
an orange/concrete-colored 8-story building, SE3, next to the Westin Building's
garage and Palace Kitchen. It was fun watching that get built out.

## Seattle Internet Exchange (SIX)

You can read all about the [Seattle Internet Exchange](https://www.seattleix.net/about) on their
web site, but the exchange is now a 20+ year-old non-profit that basically
started out in a closet of the Westin Building.

It started because some folks were frustrated by a 111ms round trip time
between 2 companies on the very same 19th floor of the Westin Exchange... turns
out their traffic was going from the 19th floor to Texas and back to the other
business.

There's also a very cool [YouTube video with Jared Reimer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ChhZcH2ok)
that's fun to watch.

As of 2017 they had 284 participants in the exchange who pay a one-time
reasonable fee for a specified port type; today at peak they aggregate over a
terabit of traffic.

Awesome graphs and stats https://www.seattleix.net/statistics/

Interesting peers according to their their transparent
switch records (
[cool list](https://www.seattleix.net/participants/switches/SIX_7512R.txt),
[another cool list](https://www.seattleix.net/participants/switches/SIX_7508E.txt):

- Amazon
- Dropbox
- Facebook
- Google
- GitHub
- Microsoft
- Netflix

This includes all the cloud computing providers. My ISP, wave, has a 40Gbps
connection between its network and SIX.

If I `traceroute` from my home to a VM I have in Azure, I see just a hops,
each a millisecond or two at most:

1. My UniFi router
2. My building's router
3. Wave G / Spectrum network
4. Seattle Internet Exchange router
5. `six2.microsoft.com`
6. Various hops around into the right place

If I trace the route to Google, they peer directly with Spectrum, so it's even
fewer hops to them (8 hops from my PC to 8.8.8.8).

## Competition

Three years ago, the [Seattle City Council ended the "cable franchise" system](https://www.geekwire.com/2015/seattle-city-council-approves-legislation-that-eliminates-cable-tv-franchise-districts/)
in the city, enabling multiple cable providers to finally compete for service.
This is most evident in our condo now: for over a decade our
building was served by what is today known as "Wave Broadband", but has had other
names such as Millennium Digital in the past. In late 2017, Comcast brought conduit
into our building's main distribution frame and then to each floor's independent
distribution frame, so today every unit in our building has complete choice
between 5 providers, including 2 cable providers for TV, Internet, etc..

While the franchise rules were removed a few years ago, only recently did our
building's 10-year contract expire (with an exclusivity clause) expire,
allowing us to open the cable portion of the building up to multiple providers.

Every individual unit in our building has their own choice between multiple of the
following providers:

- CenturyLink traditional phone and DSL
- Wave broadband cable TV, Internet, phone
- Comcast cable TV, Internet, phone
- Wave G Gigabit Internet
- DirecTV satellite TV service

I believe that most people in our building use Wave G for Internet, but I do not
have data. Not having a modem between the provider is clean and simple.

Comcast is even starting to bow to the pressure of "gigabit",
probably because all the Seattle tech employees living near downtown are in big
modern apartment buildings with Wave G. While Comcast is advertising "gig speeds",
they still tend to have slower upload capacity, bandwidth caps, and that whole
corporate Philadelphia thing going against it. Will be interesting to see how
the DOCSIS 3.1 rollout goes for more communities.

# My UniFi network

Separation of concerns is central to any software developer's mindset, and when it comes
to the ever-important home network, until recently "enterprise-grade" networking has been
rather expensive and frankly not always worth it.

For years I've had managed Cisco switches at home and then consumer-grade routers,
and it was never a great combination...

To take advantage of my fast connectivity now, I've adopted the full line of
[Ubiquiti Networks](https://www.ubnt.com/) gear - originally to take advantage
of their great access points, and then realizing the value of the full line of
integrated UniFi products, it was the right move to make.

While there are many other Ubiquiti success stories on the Internet, this one is mine,
and 2 years in I'm still a huge fan.

I enjoyed reading [Troy Hunt's post](https://www.troyhunt.com/ubiquiti-all-the-things-how-i-finally-fixed-my-dodgy-wifi/);
also, a shoutout to [Clint Rutkas](https://twitter.com/ClintRutkas) for sharing his
experience - he embarked on a similar journey around the same time as I did,
and I know many of my coworkers at Microsoft also have great Ubiquiti experiences.

I absolutely love the advanced features that Ubiquiti offers at in easy-to-use manner. From
VLAN tagging to multiple wireless networks, guest network features and advanced
connectivity options, its all there.

In the past I've had site-to-site VPN running between one of my Azure virtual
networks in a Microsoft datacenter and my home... I could then connect to a
dedicated wireless LAN through RADIUS to connect to my cloud machines. Fun stuff.

## UniFi Controller (CloudKey)

All of your UniFi network sites are controlled through a central place, the
UniFi controller. While you could install the controller on a notebook or a
server, the best route to go is to pick up the UniFi CloudKey. The CloudKey
has the controller installed on it and then you can access the management
website from anywhere.

Instead of independently configuring your router's via its IP address and its
portal, then the same for your managed switches, everything is consistent in
the controller.

Think of the CloudKey as the best $100 investment for a Raspberry Pi-like server.

Here's a look at the home screen in the controller, where you can see overall
site status, stats on connected devices, throughput.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/unifi-overview-home.png" class="img-responsive"
     title="Accessible from anywhere online, the UniFi controller software provides a simple, clean interface that lets you manage the family of network devices from a central place." />

### Devices view

All of the UniFi network devices that are a part of your network site appear within
the 'Devices' page.

This also includes devices that were "adopted" in the past, but are not actively
connected, as well as devices that are new, "pending adoption".

Once you adopt a device, it can be controlled through your controller instance.

In this view of my home UniFi network, you can see:

- My USG Security Gateway Pro (router)
- Multiple UniFi managed switches
- An access point
- A new UniFi AP AC-HD access point that is ready to be adopted
- A disconnected/disabled device - an old access point (that I was replacing in this screenshot)

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/unifi-device-adoption-screen.png" class="img-responsive"
     title="When you connect a new UniFi device to your local network, you 'adopt' the device through the controller, at which point you can configure and control it. You can also see devices that are disabled or not currently connected, but that have been adopted." />

Here's the condo building's security camera and office network - it has more devices, and I've
opened up the details for one of the PoE switches in this view.

For each connected port, you get high-level status, information about whether it is powered
by PoE, and then a summary for the device - stats including how long it's been up, what version
of the UniFi firmware it is running, overall power consumption and temperature.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/unifi-devices-building.png" class="img-responsive"
     title="In the Devices view, you see all the Ubiquiti UniFi equipment you have such as access points, the router, and managed switches. This view is from a larger network deployment for our condo building common areas and staff use." />

### Clients view

Within the controller you can drill down into the client view that shows you
individual devices that have connected.

For each device you can learn how it is connected to the network, whether a switch
port or a specific wireless network, its current activity level and stats, and how
long it has been on the network.

You can filter and sort the view by type of connection or other properties.

You can also manually add clients or view all configured clients if you are managing
devices that have static IPs, specific tags or properties, but are currently not
connected.

This view is of the clients connected to my condo building's private network (this is
not my home network). It has more clients connected so looks more interesting.

On the right side, there's a panel open taking a look at one of the UniFi PoE switches
on the network and also one of the access points - you can have multiple configuration
panels open at once to maintain your productivity in managing the site.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/unifi-clients-building.png" class="img-responsive"
     title="The  clients view shows all of the connected devices, high-level stats, current activity, and the ability to configure, tag and customize connections for that client." />

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/rack-with-sgpro.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="" />


### Events

A rolling stream of events can be accessed within the UniFi Controller, and I also have these events
streamed to a remote syslog server running on my network-attached storage server.

It's especially interesting to watch access points that experience interference and need to switch
channels and watch clients come and go.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/unifi-events-building.png" class="img-responsive"
     title="Events such as interference on wireless channels, administrators signing into the controller, PoE devices coming online, and new clients are all shown in this area. I also pipe all of these events to my network attached storage." />

## UniFi Access Points

Power over Ethernet makes it super simple to add access points exactly where
you want them, instead of where it's close to your Internet router or cable
modem.

The only job of an AP is to make wireless happen; being able to offload that
from the router makes diagnostics easier.

Here's one of the access points I've installed along an edge of a kitchen living
area. Plenum CAT6 runs through the soffit to where the access point is mounted
on the wall.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/ubnt-wifi-hallway.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="A UniFi access point is wall mounted above a hallway" />

In a bedroom, I have another access point installed. Visually it blends in to
the wall just like the emergency building intercom and Nest Protect already
on the wall.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/ubnt-wifi-bedroom.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="A UniFi access point mounted alongside a bedroom wall" />

### Wall or ceiling mount

UniFi Access Points (UAP) are easy to mount - ceiling, wall mount, ceiling
tile in a business environment, etc.

While I would love to have this mounted on the ceiling for the best reception
and range, my ceiling is concrete, so no options there without running exposed
CAT6 along the ceiling.

While you could mount the access point around a low voltage old work box or
near a CAT6 keystone, I've chosen to keep a service loop of CAT6 in the wall
and then simply attached a CAT6 end that I've poked through the wall.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/ubnt-uap-wall-install.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="Wall mounting an access point" style="max-width:500px" />

The access point rotates onto the base frame, and to remove it, you can use a
paperclip to wedge the removal point.

### LED indicator light

At the site-wide level you can toggle LED indicator lights on and off, and then
per Ubiquiti device, you can configure whether to override that setting by
forcing the LED on or off.

The soft blue glow when the access point may be nice in a business setting or
a living room to indicate that the connectivity is good, but I have chosen to
turn off the glow in my other location in a bedroom.

The indicator light can also illuminate in different colors and patterns if
it is upgrading firmware, having connectivity issues, etc.

<img src="{{ site.cdn }}2018network/ubnt-uap-blue-night.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="A soft blue glow indicates that the access point is powered, connected and healthy" />

#### Pro mounting system

While installing some access points in shared community areas of my condo
building, I discovered the [UniFi Professional Mounting System](https://store.ubnt.com/products/unifi-professional-mounting-plate)
which is a $9 precision-crafted bracket.

We've used these in our parking garage where we were able to easily mount the
access points to standard 4"x4" electrical boxes that were secured to the concrete
ceiling.

In the above photo, on the left: the bracket mounted to a 4"x4" square junction
box. Flexible conduit attaches to the j-box and CAT6 runs through it into the box
and then through the hole to be plugged into the AP. On the right, the access
point once mounted and powered up via PoE with its signature blue glow.

The brackets are a fair value and have holes for traditional wall mount, T-bar ceiling mounts (common commercial drop ceilings),
3.5" round j-boxes, 4" square j-boxes, 1-gang outlet boxes, 4" round j-boxes,
and european outlet boxes. Slick, simple design.

## Neighboring access point data

One of the unfortunate side effects of living in the city is that you are
competing with hundreds of other access points, wireless devices, even radar.

If I open my Mac and try and pick a wireless connection, there are hundreds to
scroll through.

The UniFi controller is also always collecting data on neighboring access points. In
the past they called this the "Rogue AP report", but it was renamed.

I could imagine a business using this to keep tabs on whether people are bringing
their own wireless access points or routers into the corporate environment,
but in a city, it's mostly interesting to just get a bird's eye view of how
much connectivity is around.

I regularly see 400-500 access points listed in this report.

## RF environment scans

If you are OK to take an access point offline for a few minutes, UniFi APs are
able to perform a scan of the 2G and 5G wireless utilization around that access
point. This can be very helpful in planning how to allocate channels and
diagnose performance issues.

Here's a side-by-side of the 2G and 5G environment in my main living area. The
2G wireless spectrum is almost entirely bogged down by all of the competing
devices, but the 5G channels are much more readily available.

I must use 5GHz wireless devices as much as possible.

Getting 400+ up an down over WiFi is quite an accomplishment for me, with all
the interference in the city, this is about the most that I've ever been able
to maintain beyond the wired network.





## UniFi deep packet inspection

In this screenshot, I've selected my Apple TV client entry. The Deep Pack Inspection experience lets me see a summary of the services that the client has been using. Looks like we use most of our media streaming bandwidth on HBO Now, Netflix, etc.

## Fan noise


One issue I had, with my home office use of the UniFi equipment, is that I do not have a nicely cooled server room to store the equipment in. Instead, the equipment is in the media cabinet connected to my home office.

The fans in both the UniFi 24-port PoE switch and also the security gateway were too noisy for my taste, so I replaced them with Noctua brand quiet fans. It's much nicer now, though my warranty is probably voided. The cost for a quiet home environment.

# Condo challenges

## WiFi in the city

## CAT3

## As-built records

## Metal studs

An interesting side effect of living in a high-rise building is that our tower is constructed
with common commercial construction materials, so in our building we have steel studs supporting
the walls as opposed to wood.

This makes pulling wires more difficult, you need to use wire grommits to protect the wires, and
if you cannot find an existing penetration in the studs, you need to improvise. A positive of the
metal studs, however, is that there is a not a wood fire block halfway up the wall as you might
find if you're wiring CAT6 across multiple levels in a traditional American home.

## Interior vs exterior walls

Our condo association rules are more strict about "limited common" walls (those shared with the community
or other owners), so it's easy to run wires and things within your own interior walls, but if you are
dealing with the exterior walls you need to instead run cables through exposed conduit, behind the baseboards,
under the floors, etc.

Fun stuff.

In my office, which shares a common wall with another unit, I have several cables running under the floor
now, including speaker wire, several CAT6 pulls, and 2x digital optical audio cables.
