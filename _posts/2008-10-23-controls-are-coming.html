<p>Now that the wait is over and Silverlight 2 is out there in the wild, there's very little excuse not to be using this awesome Microsoft platform. Easy-to-use controls make fast, easy development possible, and there is a clear roadmap out there now on what all is going on.</p>  <p>Last week I was really bunkered down with Silverlight. That and upgrading to the 64-bit Photoshop. That's nice, but I'm always pressing Alt-Tab to use Expression Blend. You really can build expressive apps with Silverlight.</p>  <p>I know for a fact that there's some neat work happening in the community, and do apologize for being silent on the blogging front. Here's some of what's going on.</p>  <h3>Built-in controls</h3>  <p>The controls that ship with the Silverlight 2 runtime and SDK are slick. They received crisp, refined styles this time around, and the experience for application and interface developers is feeling similar to WPF now. There's also a progress bar and password box built-in now.</p>  <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/toolkit/NewSilverlightThemes.png" /> </p>  <p>If you're not using the DataGrid in your apps, you're missing out: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scmorris/archive/2008/10/14/silverlight-2-datagrid-is-released.aspx">Scott Morrison has been busy updating</a> all of the great DataGrid tutorials for the final release version. Key messages: Performance, customizable, and new features too, like multi-selection.</p>  <h3>Silverlight Toolkit</h3>  <p>With the final Silverlight 2 release a little over a week ago, Shawn Burke blogged about the progress that we're making on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/10/14/silverlight-2-released-silverlight-toolkit-on-the-way.aspx">Silverlight Toolkit</a>. There are neat controls in the pic that he posted: Expander, a TreeView, NumericUpDown, and an AutoComplete text box.</p>  <p><img alt="DataGrid thing" src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/toolkit/SampleControl.png" /></p>  <p><em>Oops. I hit the wrong button, and Windows Live Writer seems to have posted a screenshot of a sample that I had up on my desktop... hmm... It sort of looks like a text box. And a drop down. Yet it has a DataGrid, too. Interesting...</em></p>  <p>So, stay tuned. Reiterating the cool things Shawn's talked about:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-pl.html">MS-PL</a>, open source from Microsoft</li>    <li>Things you've been missing: WrapPanel. DockPanel.</li>    <li>Accompanying unit &amp; integration tests built with the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut/">Silverlight Unit Test Framework</a></li> </ul>  <h3>Watermarked TextBox Control</h3>  <p>Yesterday Tim Heuer posted some <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/10/22/silverlight-watermark-text-box-control.aspx">Watermarked TextBox goodness</a> on his blog, in case you were looking for that one.</p>  <h3>SilverlightContrib</h3>  <p>A few days ago a friend pointed me to the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/silverlightcontrib/">SilverlightContrib</a> project. I'll admit I don't know a lot about it, other than the bullet points I saw on the homepage. I'm not associated with this project in any way, but want to give it props. Just look at some of the things it has:</p>  <ul>   <li>Zip compression</li>    <li>Utilities galore: byte utilities. string utilities. animation stuff</li>    <li>Some selection controls and gauges.</li> </ul>  <p>Check it out! There is a <a href="http://silverlightcontrib.org/demo/">live demo page</a> out there, too.</p>  <h3>Here comes PDC</h3>  <p>If you're looking for something to do next weekend, it sounds like all the Microsoft geeks will be converging on the Los Angeles Convention Center for <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Default.aspx">PDC 2008</a>. There is even a nice convincing <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Letter.aspx">letter you can send your boss</a>. Let me know if that works for you.</p>  <h3>Stay tuned!</h3>  <p>I've been involved in Silverlight for a few years now, in one capacity or another - and the trip has been awesome. </p>  <p>I won't reminisce much, other than to say that I do have vivid memories of the weeks that debugging didn't work... the weeks that the wrong clicks in a sequence could cause problems... What was released last week is <strong>solid.</strong> </p>  <p>Major kudos to everyone that made the release happen, it has been a pleasure working with you all. Now we're going to see just how fun this gets. There's more to come.</p>
