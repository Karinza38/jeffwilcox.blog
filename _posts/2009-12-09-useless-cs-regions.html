<p>I’ve seen many ways of grouping C# source over the years, but one that I never fully appreciated as being disgusting until this year was grouping like PMEs: public methods, protected methods, etc.</p>  <p>Sure, many source formatting guidelines (and perhaps even default <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis">StyleCop</a> settings) suggest this grouping style. But, tell me: what is useful about this?</p>  <p>Here’s the Grid.cs source file from WPF. Are the comments helpful? Are the regions?</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Grid" border="0" alt="Grid" src="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Grid.png" width="685" height="620" /> </p>  <p>I’d much rather see this file grouped into like functionality, if regions need to be used: give me size sharing source in one region, basic layout arrangement functions in another, and then perhaps all the dependency properties together.</p>  <p>Not sure what others think, but I hope to never have to open another file like Grid.cs and see this sort of thing. Just not my thing.</p>
