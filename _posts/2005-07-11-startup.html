I joined Microsoft on July 11, 2005, after graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in Computer Science. I joined as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) within the .NET Framework platform, on the ASP.NET team.

From then through October 2006, I maintained a less-than-useful blog. In Nov. '06 I refocused the blog on more technical topics.
