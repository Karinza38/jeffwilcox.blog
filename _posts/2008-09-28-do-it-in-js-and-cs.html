<p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/rc0/JSandCSshirt.png" align="right"/> Just because you <em>can</em> do something doesn't mean that you <em>should</em> do something. Just because you can get <a href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=quake+iphone&amp;">Quake to run on your iPhone</a> doesn't mean that's the best way to do things. But it's pretty cool!</p> <p>Now that we're clear on that one, this is the part where I show you that you can do a ton of stuff in Silverlight, through the JavaScript interoperability features.</p> <p>Reaching out to the browser can help you improve the fit and finish of your Silverlight application and to integrate with existing services.</p> <p>So, if you can do it in AJAX/JavaScript, you can totally do it in your Silverlight application when it is hosted in a web browser.</p> <p>Reasons not to use the "HTML DOM bridge" (JavaScript interoperability features) in Silverlight:</p> <ul> <li>Feels "Hacky"  </li><li>Leads to spaghetti code - the calls are very procedural and you lose the nice strongly typed features of your .NET language of choice  </li><li>One line of JavaScript often takes 3 or 4 lines of managed code to accomplish the same thing via the interop syntax  </li><li>The rich presentation framework in Silverlight is pretty awesome - you should use it!  </li><li>Potential performance implications having JavaScript - native code - managed code all involved with timers, marshalling, etc.  </li><li>Can just use JavaScript without requiring the Silverlight 2 runtime</li></ul> <p>Reasons to use it:</p> <ul> <li>Interact with the web browser host: set the page title, alter the plugin, add dynamic HTML content on the fly  </li><li>Bridge classic web applications, AJAX apps, and rich Silverlight  </li><li>Can replicate the experience of a server-side application, with web forms, HTML elements, and more - all on the client-side, without having to go back to the server to run an ASP.NET or PHP application  </li><li>A lot of analytics and advertising systems are exposed great in JavaScript</li></ul> <p>What follows is a list of some previously covered articles and examples. They may be out of date; for instance, in the Release Candidate of Silverlight, you now use the ScriptObjectCollection instead of the HtmlElementCollection. Mike Snow has a <a href="http://silverlight.net/blogs/msnow/archive/2008/09/25/silverlight-version-2-rc0-release.aspx">nice list of the breaking changes</a>.</p> <p><strong>Access and create JavaScript arrays from managed code</strong></p> <p>You <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/04/10/js-arrays/">can access JavaScript arrays</a>, but because of the loosely-defined, "do anything you want in JavaScript" way that things work, it leaves you with pretty unattractive managed code.</p> <p><a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/04/10/js-arrays/">VB samples are here</a>. Some C# samples:</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:887EC618-8FBE-49a5-A908-2339AF2EC720:623ebebf-f579-45c6-a719-94dd7706aeda" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><pre class="brush: c-sharp">// Create an array
var array = (ScriptObject) HtmlPage.Window.Eval("[10, 9, 8, 7, 6 ];");

// Get the length of an array
int length = (int)((double)array.GetProperty("length"));

// Return a single element by index
var singleElement = array.GetProperty(index.ToString())</pre></div>
<p><strong>Resize the Silverlight plugin</strong></p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/08/24/quickzeropixel/">change the size of the plugin and its host element</a>. Here's some Visual Basic that makes a "zero-pixel" plugin:</p>
<div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:887EC618-8FBE-49a5-A908-2339AF2EC720:1caf3e27-9015-4391-904a-71a87666cecd" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><pre class="vb" name="code">Imports System.Windows.Browser

Namespace System.Windows.Browser
    Public Class ZeroPixelPlugin
        ''' &lt;summary&gt;
        ''' Resizes the Silverlight plugin and its host element to be zero pixels
        ''' in width and height. Only really useful for HTML
        ''' &lt;/summary&gt;
        ''' &lt;remarks&gt;&lt;/remarks&gt;
        Public Shared Sub HideSilverlightPlugin()
            Dim plugin As HtmlElement = HtmlPage.Plugin
            Dim host As HtmlElement = plugin.Parent
            plugin.SetStyleAttribute("width", "0")
            plugin.SetStyleAttribute("height", "0")
            host.SetStyleAttribute("width", "0")
            host.SetStyleAttribute("height", "0")
        End Sub
    End Class
End Namespace</pre></div>
<p><strong>Get information about the browser and physical screen</strong></p>
<p>Wondering what the color depth is of your end users? Want to work with the available screen size? All this information is exposed by JavaScript and you can easily read the values in C#.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/06/24/browserscreeninformation/">simple static class</a> that does the work for you. The class takes care of the differences between the NPAPI web browsers and Internet Explorer, so your application doesn't need to worry about it so much.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/06/24/browserscreeninformation/"><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/rc0/BrowserScreenInformationDiagram.png"/></a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Store text in the clipboard</strong></p>
<p>If you have information that you want your end users to be able to copy into the clipboard, you only have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the text in a TextBox control, allowing a user to select and press Control + C or Command + C to copy it into their clipboard 
</li><li>Use interop features to talk to the web browser, or other plugins</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/05/21/clipboard-access/">Here's a solution</a> that uses the browser APIs in IE, and another plugin if you're on a non-IE browser. It isn't perfect, but it's an interesting hack.</p>
<p><strong>Generate an entire HTML/AJAX-style user interface</strong></p>
<p>You can write complete applications, just like an AJAX app, using managed code. Your business logic and other components benefit from strongly typed, easy-to-edit C#. Your application can be delivered through a .Xap, and doesn't have any server side dependencies if it is written just right.</p>
<p>Here was a <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/04/01/link-cloud/">homepage "link cloud" app</a>. It hasn't been updated in a while, but most of the code should work without changes in the release candidate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/04/01/link-cloud/"><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/apps/home/safari-home.png"/></a> </p>
<p>Some of the things the app and the post show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and managing HTML elements in .NET 
</li><li>Attaching and working with HTML DOM events 
</li><li>Using IsolatedStorage for saving information on the local machine</li></ul>
<p><strong>Interface with web analytics software</strong></p>
<p>A while back (yeah, Silverlight 1.1 days) I posted about <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2007/10/01/google-analytics-with-silverlight/">interfacing with Google Analytics / Urchin</a>. Although the information is still useful, Google did make some major updates to the APIs, so I'd recommend not using the Urchin implementation in the post.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else cool?</strong></p>
<p>If you're using the DOM bridge to do some interesting stuff, feel free to post a link here - I'd like to post about the neat uses at some point in the near future.</p>
<p>Well, I hope that gets you started working with the interop features a little more. Done right, you can start wearing a T-shirt the says "I do it in JavaScript... <em>AND</em> in .NET!"</p>
