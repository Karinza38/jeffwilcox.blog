Hi,
Just some quick administrivia...

<h3>Gravatar and Identicon support in comments</h3>
I've updated my blog's theme this weekend to support <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatars</a>. These are nice, and as long as you post using your e-mail address (that isn't shared with anyone, don't worry), a hash algorithm is used to retrieve your central avatar from Gravatar. A simple Identicon is generated if you haven't set one up yet.

<a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/signup">Setup your avatar online</a>
<a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement">Learn more about adding Gravatar support to your apps</a>

<h3>Improved moderation settings</h3>
I've tweaked the WordPress settings, so once you participate in the community by posting at least one comment, your future comments will appear immediately.

<h3>Twitter</h3>
I'm using <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jeffwilcox">my Twitter account</a> more often, for better or worse. I'm less concerned about remaining purely professional there, so for that reason, I've decided not to include my live Twitter stream on this blog. But if you're into it, it's a fun way to have conversations. 

Thanks for being part of my community, and the Silverlight community in general,
-Jeff
