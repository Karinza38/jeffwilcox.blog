I’m glad to have launched it, have learned a lot along the way, and am excited that people continue to rave, enjoy, and share the app with their friends. (Also, version 3.3 has been published to the Windows Phone Marketplace today!)</p>  <h4>App’s in Nokia’s March App Madness!</h4>  <p>This would be a great time to vote for the app in <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/03/20/march-app-madness-social-apps/">Nokia’s March App Madness</a>, btw [<a href="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/March-App-Madness2.pdf">PDF for your brackets</a>]!

The cloud infrastructure for the app is especially interesting and a place I’m actively investing and adding features.
