<P>Microsoft® Silverlight™ marks an important step for Microsoft into the rich client space. There’s plenty of marketing-speak up at <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/">http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/</A>, so I just want to focus on a few of the bullet points in the announcements that I think are pretty cool.</P>



<UL>

<LI>VC-1 support means high definition video on both the Mac and PC, in an efficient format.&nbsp; I can’t wait to start publishing screencasts and other media presentations that target Silverlight.&nbsp; Up until now there hasn’t been a way to offer your Microsoft VC-1 content to OS X users that I’m aware of.</LI>



<LI>Integration with existing web technologies is a key point that I am proud of: I like to view rich plugins like Silverlight and Flash as a tool for when you need to go the extra mile, use interactive video, etc., instead of a replacement for every site out there—XHTML and CSS are great for a reason!</LI>



<LI>Microsoft PlayReady support (page says “coming in Fall 2007”) indicates that there will be digital rights management support for both the PC and Mac, which I think is going to be attractive to a lot of companies that right now are using Microsoft DRM and only able to support the Windows platform.&nbsp;</LI>

</UL>



<P>I’m excited to share more details and hope to interact with everyone at <A class="" href="http://www.visitmix.com/" mce_href="http://www.visitmix.com/">MIX ’07</A>: see you in Las Vegas at the end of the month!</P>
