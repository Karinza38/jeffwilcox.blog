<p>There are great libraries out there written or ported to C# that let us developers rock by standing on the shoulders of giants. Here’s one such project.</p>  <p>A phone developer who’s also an enthusiast of foursquare suggested a feature that I should add in a future release, and provided some sample code based on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zxing/">zxing barcode library</a> and the <a href="http://silverlightzxing.codeplex.com/">Silverlight port of it</a>. I’m working on adding the new feature soon.</p>  <p>In the process I realized it would be a good and quick opportunity to ship such a simple but useful control to the phone development community, so I’ve gone ahead and pushed that control refactoring and implementation to GitHub, check it out: <a href="https://github.com/jeffwilcox/wpqr-control">https://github.com/jeffwilcox/wpqr-control</a>&#160;</p>  <p>Special thanks to Michael Osthege (<a href="http://twitter.com/theCake">@theCake</a>, <a href="http://kuchenzeit.wordpress.com/">blog</a>) for providing the initial contact, sample, and encouragement.</p>  <p>The control is nice:</p>  <ul>   <li>Drop it on the design surface</li>    <li>Wire up the ScanComplete event (and optionally the Error event)</li>    <li>The control handles all the underlying image manipulation, scanning work, PhotoCamera initialization, etc.</li> </ul>  <p>Here’s what a simple sample app looks like in use. The control includes default border thickness and coloring properties that use the accent color and provide a nice visual separator:</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="ReadingQR" border="0" alt="ReadingQR" src="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ReadingQR.jpg" width="685" height="514" /></p>  <p>Technically the control will expand to its container size, but I prefer the squared-off 400x400 grid myself.</p>  <h3>Building the sample app</h3>  <p>All I did to build this app was drop the control into a new Windows Phone app project and wire it up. Here’s how.</p>  <h4>References and XMLNS</h4>  <p>Add either a project reference (if you cloned the git repo) <em>or</em> build the project and include references to assemblies, both the zxing library plus this control library.</p>  <p>To your XAML page where you’d like to use the control, make sure to include a namespace. Here’s what I used:</p>  <pre><font size="2" face="Consolas">xmlns:jwqr=&quot;clr-namespace:JeffWilcox.Controls;assembly=JeffWilcox.Controls.QR&quot;</font></pre>

<h4>Add the control</h4>

<p>I added this XAML to my MainPage’s ContentPanel area:</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">&lt;jwqr:QRCodeScanner
    ScanComplete=&quot;QRCodeScanner_ScanComplete&quot;
    Error=&quot;QRCodeScanner_Error&quot;
    Width=&quot;400&quot;
    Height=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<h4>Implement code behind</h4>

<p>The event handlers are easy enough. In my case, I went for these (just throwing exceptions):</p>

<pre class="brush: c-sharp">private void QRCodeScanner_ScanComplete(object sender, JeffWilcox.Controls.ScanCompleteEventArgs e)
{
    ApplicationTitle.Text = e.Result;
}

private void QRCodeScanner_Error(object sender, JeffWilcox.Controls.ScanFailureEventArgs e)
{
    throw e.Exception;
}</pre>

<h4>Run the project on a Windows Phone</h4>

<p>Hit F5! When you hover over a QR code, you should see its embedded text appear in place of the application title (top of the page).</p>

<h4>Future/Improvements</h4>

<p>I’d like to maybe add a sound when the scan is successful, but right now, nothing like that.</p>

<p>Eventually I may package this up as a NuGet package, but I’m not ready to prep the right spec files plus figure out how to properly attribute the sub-libraries at this time. So fork the <a href="https://github.com/jeffwilcox/wpqr-control">GitHub</a> version in the meantime! License is Apache 2.0 for both this library as well as the underlying zxing project.</p>

<p>(Looking to display codes? A few years back I briefly talked about the QR code system used by the sweet Starbucks mobile app on the iPhone. I implemented a prototype for Silverlight and Windows Phone that lets you render a QR code on the app’s surface, thanks to a nice QR code library. That <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2010/03/windowsphone-barcode/">post is here</a>.)</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
