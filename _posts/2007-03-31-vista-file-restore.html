<P>Last week a lot of my hard work was saved by Windows Vista and its updated System Restore capabilities.&nbsp; There are a lot of features hiding in Vista that not everyone is aware of, and this is one of those that is a real lifesaver but hidden away with that right mouse click.</P>



<P>While cleaning up an enlistment to some code, I accidentally permanently deleted a very large tree that included some important code changes, representing a few hours of work over two days on refactoring.&nbsp; “Oops.”&nbsp; At this point, my first instinct was to run to one of those great undeleted tools such as <A class="" href="http://www.handyrecovery.com/" mce_href="http://www.handyrecovery.com/">HandyRecovery</A>… Until Windows actually recovers and overwrites the data on the drive, your deleted data is really still sitting there waiting to be reused.</P>



<P>However, I then remember that Volume Shadow Copy Service (or some form of it) had been meshed together with System Restore, and should be running on the machine.&nbsp; Thankfully it was, and it is really pretty easy to use—you can restore to a previous version, or simply save the previous version elsewhere.</P>

<P>To use the tool, simply right-click on a file that you would like to&nbsp;examine previous versions of, and select 'Restore previous versions'.&nbsp; If you've deleted an entire directory or directory tree like I have,&nbsp;right click on the parent directory&nbsp;and start from there.&nbsp;</P>



<P>Everything was right where I’d remembered it, no data lost, and a big feeling of relief (and thanks to the Windows client guys).</P>
