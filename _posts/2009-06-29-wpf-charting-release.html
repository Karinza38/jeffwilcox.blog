Just passing along the word, if you caught my <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2009/03/mymix09-session/">MIX '09 talk</a> this year (or grabbed the <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2009/04/mix09-source/">sources</a>), I demonstrated the Silverlight Toolkit's charting components running on WPF. At the time, I mentioned that we had high hopes to bring them into WPF, and that has finally happened!
