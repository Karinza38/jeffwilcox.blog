<p>As an FYI, I wanted to let people know that I’m now focusing much more exclusively on the Windows Phone project here at Microsoft. Though the organization boundaries aren’t that exciting, I am still part of the great Silverlight team – only now more focused on the phone development story.</p>  <p><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/RWtlxXC0Xnc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/RWtlxXC0Xnc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object></p>  <p>It’s a familiar crowd: many of the brightest from across the company have been joining the ranks, and a lot of the classic Silverlight Toolkit team members are a part of the effort.</p>  <p>The focus of this blog won’t be changing much at all – I continue to be involved in Silverlight Toolkit, the Silverlight Unit Test Framework, and anything else I can get my hands on.</p>
