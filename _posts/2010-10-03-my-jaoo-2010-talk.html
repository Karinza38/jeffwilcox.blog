<p>Updated 10/4 post-talk: Slides are available for 4.5MB either as <a href="http://d2bk44826ux9xe.cloudfront.net/wilcox_jaoo_2010.pptx">PPTX</a> or <a href="http://d2bk44826ux9xe.cloudfront.net/wilcox_jaoo_2010.pdf">PDF</a>. There is a lot more information in the slide deck, I wish I had time to review it all properly at a more leisurely pace!</p>  <p>Thank you for everyone who attended.</p>  <h2>Original post before the talk</h2>  <p>This week is the <a href="http://jaoo.dk/">JAOO Conference in Aarhus, Denmark</a> (Oct. 3-8), and I’m happy to be presenting on Monday 10/4 in the afternoon on Windows Phone 7 app dev. More information on my talk is <a href="http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2010/presentation/Exploring%20Windows%20Phone%207%20Application%20Development">available here</a>, and the full line-up for <a href="http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2010/schedule/monday.jsp">Monday is here</a>.</p>  <ul>   <li>Mobile Track </li>    <li>14:45 – 15:45 </li>    <li>Location: Filuren, Musikhuset </li> </ul>  <p>The talk will be a whirlwind adventure over the hour, so even if you aren’t familiar with the Silverlight development platform, you’ll still be able to learn plenty about the phone, the development story for apps, and what features and capabilities there are. And yes, I’ll even cover a few limitations and offer performance tips.</p>  <p>A very rough outline of the talk is:</p>  <ul>   <li>Introduction to Windows Phone 7 </li>    <li>About Silverlight for Windows Phone </li>    <li>Controls </li>    <li>Threading </li>    <li>Navigation &amp; Pages </li>    <li>Specialized Controls </li>    <li>Pivot </li>    <li>Panorama </li>    <li>Application Lifetime </li>    <li>Launchers &amp; Choosers </li>    <li>Hardware APIs </li>    <li>Performance </li>    <li>Limitations </li>    <li>Marketplace </li> </ul>  <p>I look forward to meeting everyone in Aarhus!</p>  <p>After the talk I will also be posting online the slides.</p>
