# Hi.

I'm a software developer "and whatever it takes" at Microsoft.

I've been at MSFT since I graduated from the University of Michigan and have had unique opportunities at Microsoft to help work on shipping several products from start through maturity, including Silverlight 2-5 (the XAML plug-in for browsers) and Windows Phone 7-8 (the next generation rewrite of Microsoft's mobile operating system, client development experience and UI frameworks).

Today I work on the Azure team on special assignment as a Principal Staff Architect. We're a different Microsoft: we often ship and develop our code in the open on GitHub.

I am also the developer of 4th &amp; Mayor, the top-rated social application on the Windows Phone Store, designed as a simple, crisp and easy third party client for the foursquare service.
