# Hi.

I'm a software developer "and whatever it takes" at Microsoft.

I've been at MSFT since I graduated from the University of Michigan and have had unique opportunities at Microsoft to help work on shipping several V1 products (including Windows Phone and Silverlight).

Today I work on the Developer Experience team for Windows Azure. We're a different Microsoft: we ship and develop our code in the open on GitHub.

I am also the developer of 4th &amp; Mayor, the top-rated social application on the Windows Phone Store.
